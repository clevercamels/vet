# CPR

- **Steps**
  1. Begin chest compressions - 100-120 compressions/minute
  2. Ventilate - intubate in lateral recumbency while continuing compressions - give  
     1 breath every 6 seconds (10 breaths/minute)
  3. Initiate monitoring - ECG, ETCO2  
     - If ETCO2 >15 mmHg - good compressions
  4. Obtain vascular access  
     - Asystole/pulseless electrical activity (PEA)  
       - Low dose epinephrine and/or vasopressin every other BLS cycle  
       - Atropine every other BLS cycle (every other from epinephrine)  
       - If no response, give high dose epinephrine  
     - Ventricular fibrillation (VF)/pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT)  
       - Charge defibrillator, clear and give 1 shock  
         - Monophasic - 4-6 J/kg  
         - Biphasic - 2-4 J/kg  
       - If prolonged VF/VT  
         - Lidocaine  
         - Low dose epinephrine and/or vasopressin every other BLS cycle  
         - Increase defibrillator dose by 50%  
     - Donâ€™t be afraid to do a cut down to get IV access  
     - If unable to get IV access, can give epinephrine/vasopressin/atropine IT diluted with saline  
     - **Doses**  
       - Epinephrine - 0.01 mg/kg IV  
       - Vasopressin - 0.8 U/kg IV  
       - Atropine - 0.04 mg/kg IV  
  5. Administer reversals if indicated  
     - Opioids - naloxone  
     - Alpha2 agonists - atipamezole  
     - Benzodiazepines - flumazenil  
  6. One full cycle = 2 minutes - change person performing compressions every cycle/2 minutes

- **OK, you got your patient back. Now what?**
  - Ventilate for patient if not breathing on their own adequately until they are able to  
    - Manual ventilation vs ventilator  
    - Monitor ETCO2 - keep between 35-40  
  - Stabilize hemodynamically  
    - Resolve hypotension  
    - Monitor lactate until normalized  
  - Protect brain/nervous system  
    - Concerns  
      - Hypoxic injury  
      - Ischemic injury  
      - Reperfusion injury  
    - Therapies  
      - Address any seizure activity (see seizure section)  
      - Reduce intracranial edema with mannitol or hypertonic saline  
        - Mannitol - 0.5-1 g/kg through a filter over 20 minutes  
          - Do not give if patient is hypotensive  
        - Hypertonic saline - 3-5 mL/kg over 20 minutes  
          - Monitor sodium q4-6 hours later  
  - Prognosis - grave; better if anesthetic related
