# Emergency Protocol: Ventricular Tachycardia - Cats

This protocol outlines emergency management for presumed or confirmed ventricular tachycardia (VT) in feline patients. It is intended as a guide and should be adapted based on the individual patient's condition and response to treatment.

## 1. Initial Assessment and Stabilization

* Establishment of intravenous (IV) access is crucial.
* Administer supplemental oxygen.
* Perform a brief, focused physical examination to assess for signs of instability:
    * Weakness or collapse
    * Hypotension
    * Poor perfusion (pale mucous membranes, prolonged capillary refill time)
    * Dyspnea or tachypnea
    * Cool extremities

## 2. Electrocardiogram (ECG)

* Obtain a continuous ECG tracing to confirm the presence of ventricular tachycardia and assess heart rate and QRS morphology.
* *Characteristics of VT on ECG in cats may include a ventricular rate typically > 220 bpm (though can be lower in some cases of accelerated idioventricular rhythm), wide and bizarre QRS complexes (> 40 ms), and dissociation between P waves and QRS complexes.*

## 3. Emergency Treatment - If Patient is Unstable or VT is Causing Compromise

* **Lidocaine**
    * Considered a first-line antiarrhythmic for feline VT, especially if associated with underlying systemic disease or myocardial insult.
    * **Dosage:** 0.25-0.75 mg/kg IV bolus slowly over 1-2 minutes.
    * *Monitor ECG continuously during administration.*
    * May repeat bolus once or twice to a maximum cumulative dose of 2 mg/kg IV, monitoring for adverse effects (e.g., neurological signs, gastrointestinal upset).
    * If VT is controlled or improved, initiate a constant rate infusion (CRI).
    * **CRI Dosage:** 10-40 mcg/kg/min IV.
    * *Cats are sensitive to lidocaine; use caution and monitor closely.*

* **Procainamide**
    * May be considered if lidocaine is ineffective or contraindicated.
    * **Dosage:** 3-8 mg/kg IV slowly over 20-30 minutes.
    * *Monitor ECG and blood pressure during administration.*
    * If VT is controlled or improved, a CRI may be considered.
    * **CRI Dosage:** 25-40 mcg/kg/min IV.

* **Sotalol**
    * May be considered for acute management or for longer-term control after initial stabilization. Has both beta-blocking and potassium channel blocking effects.
    * **Dosage:** 1-2 mg/kg PO every 12 hours. (Note: Oral administration is more common for ongoing management but may be used acutely if IV options are ineffective or unavailable).
    * *Use with caution in cats with evidence of congestive heart failure due to negative inotropic effects.*

## 4. Address Underlying Cause

* Simultaneously investigate and address potential underlying causes of VT, such as:
    * Hypoxia
    * Electrolyte imbalances (especially hypokalemia)
    * Acid-base abnormalities
    * Myocardial disease (e.g., hypertrophic cardiomyopathy)
    * Systemic disease (e.g., hyperthyroidism, pancreatitis, trauma)
    * Pain or stress

## 5. Monitoring

* Continuous ECG monitoring is essential to assess the response to treatment and detect recurrence of VT or development of other arrhythmias.
* Monitor blood pressure closely.
* Monitor respiratory rate and effort.
* Monitor packed cell volume (PCV) and total solids (TS).
* Monitor serum electrolytes, blood glucose, and renal parameters.

## 6. Refractory VT

* If VT is refractory to initial medical management, consider consultation with a veterinary cardiologist.
* Additional antiarrhythmic agents or advanced procedures may be necessary.

## 7. Post-Stabilization

* Once the patient is stable and VT is controlled, continued monitoring and investigation into the underlying cause are necessary.
* Long-term antiarrhythmic therapy may be required.
* Inform the owner of the guarded prognosis associated with ventricular tachycardia in cats.
