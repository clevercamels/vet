## Pericardial Effusion - ER Quick Guide

**Definition:** Accumulation of fluid within the pericardial sac, leading to cardiac tamponade.

**Triage (1-2 min):**

* **Observation:** Weakness, lethargy, collapse.

* **CV:** Tachycardia, weak pulses, muffled heart sounds, jugular venous distension (JVD), pulsus paradoxus.

* **Respiratory:** Tachypnea, dyspnea.

* **Mentation:** Obtunded.

**Immediate Actions (0-5 min):**

* **O2:** Administer oxygen.

* **IV Access:** Establish IV access.

* **Fluids:** Cautious crystalloid bolus (5-10 ml/kg) if hypotensive, avoid overhydration.

* **ECG:** 

    * Electrical alternans (alternating amplitude of QRS complex)
    
    * Arrhythmias

* **Pericardiocentesis:**

    * Emergency, life-saving procedure.

    * Aspirate fluid from the pericardial sac.

**Stabilization (5-15 min):**

* **Assessment:** Reassess CV, respiratory status.

* **Diagnostics:**

    * ECG: Evaluate for arrhythmias, electrical alternans.

    * BP: often decreased

    * aFAST/POCUS: Confirm effusion, assess for tamponade.

    * Thoracic Radiography: Enlarged cardiac silhouette (globoid heart) 78% of the time.

    * Lactate: often elevated

    * PT/PTT: if warfarin ingestion

* **Treatment:**

    * Continue cautious fluids if needed.

    * Monitor for recurrence of effusion.

**Pericardiocentesis Procedure:**

* Aseptically prepare the site (right 4-5th intercostal space at the costochondral junction).

* Insert a needle/catheter (over-the-needle catheter) attached to a 3-way stopcock and syringe.

* Advance craniodorsally, aspirating continuously.

* Remove fluid slowly.

* Monitor ECG during the procedure.

**Post-Pericardiocentesis Management:**

* **Monitoring:** Continuous ECG, serial FAST/echo.

* **Fluids:** Maintain euvolemia.

* **Diagnostics:** Fluid analysis (cytology, culture).

* **Treat Underlying Cause:**

    * Neoplasia: Chemotherapy, surgery.

    * Infection: Antibiotics.

    * Coagulopathy: Treat the coagulopathy.

    * Idiopathic

* **Pericardial Window:** Consider for recurrent effusion.

**Prognosis:**

* Depends on the underlying cause.

* Guarded to poor for neoplasia.

* Good for idiopathic effusion with successful pericardiocentesis.
