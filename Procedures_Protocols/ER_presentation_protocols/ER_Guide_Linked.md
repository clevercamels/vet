* From   VIN   Veterinary   Drug   Handbook:   “Most   common   reason   for   lack   of

efficacy   as   antiarrhythmic   is   administration   of   a   dose   that   is   too   low   or   that
is   administered   too   slowly ;   start   with   IV   bolus   followed   by   CRI   (target
endpoint   =   conversion   of   arrhythmia);   if   conversion   of   arrhythmia   is
deemed   critical,   don't   assume   ineffective   until   patient   either   converts,

necessarily   have   to   crossmatch;   if   has   received   a   blood   transfusion   in   the
past,   always   crossmatch
* Always   crossmatch   with   cats

* Transfusion   administration

* Ideally,   give   over   4   hour   time   period;   if   animal   is   actively   bleeding   severely   or   is
so   anemic   he/she   is   in   critical   condition,   may   need   to   give   over   a   faster   time

hour   of   the   transfusion;   increase   incrementally   until   reaching   final   rate

* Monitor   temperature,   HR,   RR,   MM,   and   CRT   closely   *  initially   every   5-10

minutes;   after   first   hour   can   monitor   every   15-30   minutes   as   long   as   patient
tolerating   without   issue

* Some   people   pre-medicate   with   diphenhydramine   (2   mg/kg   IM)   *  others   wait   for

evidence   of   transfusion   reaction,   then   administer

* If   body   temperature   increased   by   >1   degree,   concern   for   transfusion   reaction

* Slow   rate   of   transfusion;   if   temperature   continues   to   rise,   consider

discontinuing   the   transfusion

* Paper   speed   :   50   mm/s   (interval   between   2   fine   lines   =   20   msec),

25   mm/s   (interval   between   2   fine   lines   =   40   msec)

* Sensitivity:   10   mm/mV   (interval   between   2   fine   lines   =   0.1   mV),   5

mm/mV   (2   fine   lines   =   0.2   mV)

* Generation   of   the   ECG:

* P   wave:   Atrial
depolarization

* PR   interval:
Conduction
from   SA   node
through   AV
node   to   the
ventricle

* QRS   complex:
Ventricular
depolarization

* T-wave:

Ventricular   repolarization

* QT   interval:   Complete   de-and   re-polarization
* PR   interval   *  blue
* PR   segment   *  orange
* QT   interval*  purple
* ST   segment*  green
* QRS   width*  red
* Normal   ECG   Measurements

* Dog   PR   60-130   ms,   QRS   <70   ms,   QT   150-240   ms,   P   duration   40
ms   (50   ms   giants),   P   amplitude   0.4   mV,   R   amplitude   >0.5   mV,   T
amplitude   <0.05   -1   mV

* Cat   PR   50-90   ms,   QRS   <40   ms,   QT   160-220   ms,   P   duration   <35
ms,   P   amplitude   <0.2   mV,   R   amplitude   <0.9   mV,   T   amplitude
<0.03mV

* Arrhythmia   *   anything   other   than   sinus   arrhythmia;   Rhythms   that   originate

outside   the   sinus   node,   Rate   too   fast,   Rate   too   slow

28

* FOUR   QUESTIONS   TO   ASK   BEFORE   INTERPRETING   EVERY   ECG!

* What   is   the   heart   rate   and   the   mean   electrical   axis?
* Is   the   rhythm   regular   or   irregular?
* Is   the   rhythm   supraventricular   or   ventricular?
* What   is   the   relationship   between   the   P   waves   and   the   QRS

complexes?   (Is   there   a   P   wave   for   every   QRS   and   vice   versa)

* HEART   RATE   CALCULATION

* Bic   pen   method   *   great   for   average   heart   rate;   the   bic   pen   (WITH
CAP   ON)   IS   15   CM   (eg.   3   seconds   in   50   mm/s;   6   secs   in   25
mm/s).   Count   the   number   of   complexes   that   occur   in   the   span   of
the   bic   pen   and   multiply   accordingly   (10   for   25   mm/s,   20   for   50
mm/s).

* Instantaneous   rate   *   great   for   paroxysmal   bursts   of   tachycardia;
* 50   mm/s   =   3000   mm/60s   (there   are   3000   tiny   boxes   in   a

minute   so   HR   =   3000   divided   by   the   number   of   tiny   boxes
in   between   two   complexes;   25   mm/s   =   1500   mm/30s   (HR
=   1500   divided   by   the   number   of   tiny   boxes   in   between   two
complexes)

* SITES   OF   NORMAL   AUTOMATICITY    (where   impulses   can   be   generated)

* SA   Node   *  Depolarizes   at   a   rate   faster   than   other   automatic   sites   and   so

normally   functions   as   the   PRIMARY   pacemaker,   rate   >   60   bpm   in   dogs
* AV   Node   *   will   take   over   sinus   rate   if   low   enough;   usual   rate   at   40-60   bpm

in   dogs

* Purkinje   fibers   *   rate   of   20-40   bpm   in   dogs

* Supraventricular   versus   Ventricular

* Narrow   QRS   complexes   are   usually   supraventricular,   wide   (>70   ms)   are

usually   ventricular   in   origin

* ARRHYTHMIAS

* Respiratory   Sinus   Arrhythmia    (THIS   CAN   BE   NORMAL   IN   CATS   AND

DOGS)

* Slow   HR   with   expiration,   faster   HR   with   inhalation
* Cause:   Alterations   in   autonomic   tone   varies   impulse   origin   in   the

sinus   node   resulting   in   variations   of   p   to   p   intervals   (SEE
PICTURE)

* Can   be   dependent   on   respiration   OR   Vagal   tone
* Not   present

before   4   weeks   of
age

* Common   to   SEE
variations   in   p
wave   amplitude
on   beat   to   beat
basis   (this   is
known   as
wandering
pacemaker)

* HOW   TO   DIFFERENTIATE   PATHOLOGIC   (SSS,   AV   Block)   FROM

PHYSIOLOGIC   (HIGH   VAGAL   TONE/DRUG   INDUCED)   SINUS   ARREST

29

* Atropine   response   test   (Give   0.04   mg/kg   IM/SC,   assess   ECG   every   5

minutes   thereafter

* Positive   result   (meaning   the   cause   is   physiologic)   =   sinus

tachycardia   (>   160   bpm)

* Sinus   Node   Dysfunction   (with   clinical   signs   this   is   known   as   Sick   Sinus

Syndrome)

* Breed   predispositions   :   Miniature   schnauzer,   Westies,   Dachshund,

Cocker   Spaniel

* Clinical   signs:   lethargy,   decreased   appetite,   SYNCOPE   (occurs   at

>   6   seconds   of   sinus   arrest)

* Treatment:   Surgery   (Pacemaker   implantation),   Medical   (in   order   to
increase   heart   rate)   ex.   Terbutaline,   Theophylline,   Propantheline
bromide   Hyoscyamine

* HOW   TO   DIFFERENTIATE   ESCAPE   BEAT   FROM   PREMATURE   BEAT

* Escape   beat   :   late   onset   depolarization   (ventricular   =   wide;   junctional   =

narrow)

* Premature   beat:   early   onset   depolarization   (APC   =   narrow;   VPC   =   wide)

* ABNORMAL   IMPULSE   CONDUCTION

* Sinoatrial   Block   *   In   the   SA
node   the   impulses   don’t
exit   the   node,   commonly
secondary   to   high   vagal
tone.

* Bradyarrhythmias   that   may
require   a   pacemaker   :   Sick
Sinus   Syndrome,
Persistent   atrial   standstill,
High   grade   second   degree
AV   Block,   third   degree   AV   block.

* KEY   POINTS   TO   REMEMBER   ABOUT   PACEMAKERS:   They

don’t   require   to   be   turned   off   for   humane   euthanasia   (ECG   after
injection   can   be   deceiving)

* ***YOU   MUST   REMOVE   THE   PACEMAKER   GENERATOR   VIA

DISSECTION   FROM   THE   PATIENT   BEFORE   CREMATION****   If
not   then   you   risk   blowing   up   your   local   crematorium   (not   cool).

* Persistent   Atrial   Standstill :   NO   P   WAVES,   BRADYCARDIA

* Secondary   to   atrial   cardiomyopathy

30

* Atrium   not   able   to   respond   to   impulses   from   SA   node
* The   ecg   is   made   up   of   junctional   escape   beats   (40-60   bpm)
* Breed   predisposed   for   English   Springer   Spaniels
* Treatment   =   Pacemaker   implantation
* Must   differentiate   from   transient   atrial   standstill   (aka

sinoventricular   rhythm)   (   NO   p   waves,   normal   HR,   appears
junctional   QRS   complexes,   can   be   due   to   digoxin   toxicity   or
hyperkalemia)

* Atrioventricular   Block

* First   degree   AV   Block    *   Prolonged   PR   interval

* Usually   physiologic   secondary   to   high   vagal   tone   or   drug

induced
* Second   degree   AV   Block

* Mobitz   Type   1   (Wenckebach)

* Usually   physiologic   secondary   to   high   vagal   tone   or

drug   induced

* Prolonged   PR   interval   followed   by   p   wave   without

QRS   complex

* Mobitz   Type   2

* Can   be   pathologic   or   physiologic
* Can   progress   to   3 rd    degree   AV   Block
* Normal   PR   interval   followed   by   P   wave   without

QRS   complex

* HIGH   GRADE    *  Multiple   p   waves   without   QRS

Complexes   but   association   between   P   and   QRS   is
apparent.

* Third   degree   AV   Block    (see   picture)   *   always   pathologic,   AV

dissociation

* No   association   between   the   P   wave   and   QRS   waves
* Cause:   usually   degenerative,   but   can   also   be   caused   by

neoplasia,   infectious   diseases,   cardiomyopathy,   rarely   thyroid
disease

* Cats   can   be   asymptomatic

31

* Can   result   in   sudden   death,   secondary   organ   failure   due   to   poor

circulation,   syncope,   and   secondary   CHF

* Patient   should   have   full   blood   panel,   SNAP   4DX   +/*  NCSU   tick

panel,   thoracic   radiographs,   abdominal   ultrasound,
echocardiogram,   and   atropine   response   test.
* Bundle   Branch   Blocks *  The   rhythms   originate   from   the   SA   node,   pass   through
the   AV   node   normally,   but   undergo   conduction   delay   in   the   ventricle.   These   DO
NOT   compromise   hemodynamics   therefore   no   treatment   is   needed.

* How   to   differentiate   wide   QRS   complexes   from   being   ventricular   in   origin

versus   bundle   branch   block   (SA   in   origin)

* The   presence   of   a   P-wave   in   front   of   wide   QRS   complex   =   BBB
* The   absence   of   a   p-wave   =   ventricular   in   origin

* ENLARGEMENTS   PATTERNS    in   lead   II   (remember   this   isn’t   100%   sensitive)

* Enlarged   R   wave   can   suggest   left   ventricular   enlargement
* Deep   S   wave   can   suggest   right   ventricular   enlargement
* Alternating   R   wave   amplitude   with   each   beat   *   Electrical   alternans

* This   is   created   by   swinging   of   the   long   axis   of   the   heart   inside   the
chest.   Can   occur   with   pericardial   effusion   but   NOT   ALWAYS.

* Deep   Q   wave   can   be   normal   in   deep   chested   dogs

* ANTIARRHYTHMIC   THERAPY

* Goals   of   therapy   are   rate   control   and   rhythm   control.
* Vaughan   Williams   Classification   Scheme   (only   readily   available   drugs

included   in   this   list)

* Class   1a

* Quinidine    *   useful   for   conversion   of   atrial   fibrillation   in   horses   to

sinus   rhythm.   Not   successful   in   dogs   and   cats.

* Procainamide    *   useful   for   ventricular   tachycardia   (usually   my   #1

or   #2   choice)   and   AV   nodal   independent   SVT.

*   Procainamide   is   dosed   in   dogs   at   2   mg/kg,   slow   IV   bolus,
to   a   maximum   cumulative   dose   of   25   mg/kg   over   10*15
min,   continuing   if   needed   as   a   CRI   at   25*40   mcg/kg/min   or
at   10*20   mg/kg,   tid-qid,   IM   or   SC.   The   oral   (regular)
formulation   is   dosed   at   4*6   mg/kg,   PO,   every   2*4   hr
(maintenance   dose   every   4   hr),   and   the   sustained-release
formulation   at   10*20   mg/kg,   PO,   tid.

* Class   1b

32

* Lidocaine    *   useful   for   ventricular   tachycardia   (>160-180

hemodynamically   significant   V   tach).   Also   has   been   proven   to
convert   dogs   out   of   vagally   induced   atrial   fibrillation/SVT.

* The   typical   clinical   approach   in   dogs   is   to   administer   2
mg/kg,   IV   boluses   over   ~1   min   to   effect   (slowing   the
ventricular   arrhythmia   or   conversion   to   sinus   rhythm)   or   to
a   cumulative   dose   of   8   mg/kg   over   ~30   min.   Given   the   very
short   half-life,   repeat   boluses   or   a   CRI   (25*75   mcg/kg/min)
is   needed   to   maintain   rhythm   control.   Lidocaine   is   rarely
indicated   in   cats,   because   clinically   significant   or
life-threatening   ventricular   arrhythmias   are   rare   in   this
species.   The   dosage   in   cats   is   0.1*0.4   mg/kg,   IV   bolus
over   ~1   min,   then   increase   to   a   total   dose   of   0.25*1   mg/kg,
IV   slowly,   if   no   response.   This   can   be   followed   by   a   CRI
(10*20   mcg/kg/min).   Lidocaine   has   few   undesirable
effects.   Toxicity   is   manifest   in   dogs   primarily   as   GI   and
CNS   signs.   Drowsiness   or   agitation   may   progress   to
muscle   twitching   and   convulsions   at   higher   plasma
concentrations.   Hypotension   may   develop   if   the   IV   bolus   is
given   too   rapidly.   In   cats,   which   are   more   susceptible   to
toxicity,   cardiac   suppression   and   CNS   excitation   may   be
seen.

* Mexilitine    *  oral   analogue   of   lidocaine   used   to   treat   ventricular
arrhythmias   in   dogs.   It   is   rarely   used   as   monotherapy   for
ventricular   arrhythmias.   It   is   most   often   an   adjunctive   treatment   in
severe,   chronic   ventricular   arrhythmias   not   well   controlled   by
sotalol   alone   or   in   dogs   that   do   not   tolerate   sotalol.   It   should   be
administered   at   its   lowest   effective   dose   with   food   to   limit   toxicity.
Common   adverse   effects   include   anorexia,   vomiting,   tremors,   and
hepatic   toxicity.   Hepatic   enzymes   should   be   evaluated   before
treatment   and   periodically   (approximately   every   6   mo)   during
chronic   treatment   as   well   as   any   time   GI   disturbances   develop
during   treatment.

* The   dosage   in   dogs   is   4*6   mg/kg,   PO,   TID.

* Class   II   *   Beta   Blockers

* β-adrenergic   blockers   are   used   for   a   variety   of   indications   in
veterinary   medicine,   including   control   of   inappropriate   or
undesirable   sinus   tachycardia,   treatment   of   ventricular   and
supraventricular   arrhythmias,   management   of   chronic
hypertension   in   dogs   and   cats,   and   palliation   of   adverse   effects   of
uncontrolled   hyperthyroidism   in   cats   and   pheochromocytoma   in
dogs.

* Propanolol    *   non-selective   (B1   and   B2),   half   life   in   dogs   (1.5-2h)

* The   dosage   in   dogs   is   0.2*1   mg/kg,   PO,   tid   (titrate   dose   to
effect)   and   in   cats   is   0.4*1.2   mg/kg   (2.5*5   mg/cat),   PO,   tid.
Use   of   propranolol   should   be   avoided   in   dogs   and   cats   with
evidence   of   primary   respiratory   disease   (eg,   asthma).

* Atenolol    *   selective   B1,   half   life   in   dogs   (5-6h),   cats   (3.5h)

33

* Dogs   is   0.2*1   mg/kg,   PO,   bid,   and   in   cats   1*2.5   mg/kg,

PO,   bid,   or   6.25*12.5   mg/cat,   PO,   bid.

* In   both   dogs   and   cats,   titrating   up   gradually   is   required,

especially   if   atenolol   is   initiated   in   the   face   of   active   or
stable   CHF   or   in   DCM.   In   general,   dogs   and   cats   without
CHF   and   normal   systolic   function   can   tolerate   higher   initial
and   target   dosages.    Abrupt   discontinuation   should   be
avoided;   if   cessation   is   indicated,   titrating   down
gradually   is   recommended   (this   applies   to   all   beta
blockers).    If   CHF   develops   in   an   animal   receiving   atenolol,
the   dosage   may   need   to   be   reduced   and   the   drug
eventually   discontinued,   but   unless   the   CHF   is
life-threatening,   abrupt   cessation   should   still   be   avoided.
Potential   adverse   effects   are   dose   related   and   more   likely
if   underlying   systolic   function   is   present.   Adverse   effects
include   myocardial   depression,   bradycardia   (sinus   and   AV
block),   and   hypotension.

* Esmolol    *   selective   B1,   this   drug   is   great   because   of   its   ultra   short
duration   of   action.   I’ve   used   it   in   cases   to   assess   if   a   beta   blocker
would   be   helpful   in   slowing   down   SVT   or   V   tach   or   just
tachycardia   in   general.   Half   Life   =   8   minutes.   It   only   comes   in   IV
formulations.
* Class   III   *   K   Channel   Blockers

* Sotalol    *   non-selective,   reaches   peak   plasma   concentration,   most

commonly   used   long   term   treatment   for   hemodynamically
significant   ventricular   arrhythmias   in   dogs   and   cats.   It   is   often
used   as   monotherapy   for   this   indication   but   can   be   combined   with
mexiletine   if   rhythm   control   is   suboptimal   with   sotalol   alone.   It   has
some   efficacy   in   treatment   of   atrial   fibrillation   (rate   control),   but   it   is
not   as   efficacious   as   other   agents   and   is   not   commonly   used   for
this   indication.   Sotalol   is   safe   and   well   tolerated   and   is   often   used
in   combination   with   other   drugs   commonly   used   to   treat   heart
disease   and   heart   failure,   including   ACE   inhibitors,   furosemide,
spironolactone,   and   pimobendan.   Because   it   has   β-blocking
effects,   it   should   not   be   combined   with   other   β-blockers   (eg,
atenolol)   or   other   negative   inotropes   (eg,   diltiazem).   In   addition,   it
should   not   be   combined   with   another   class   III   agent   (eg,
amiodarone).

* The   dosage   in   dogs   and   cats   is   1*2.5   mg/kg,   PO,   bid.   It
should   be   used   with   caution   and   at   the   lower   end   of   the
dosage   range   in   patients   with   CHF   or   DCM   or   when
combined   with   mexiletine.   In   this   situation,   titrating   up
(dosage   increases   every   10*14   days)   to   a   higher   target
dose   may   be   attempted   if   lower   doses   are   not   efficacious.
Dogs   and   cats   with   normal   systolic   function   can   tolerate
higher   initial   and   target   doses.

* Possible   adverse   effects   include   negative   inotropy,

bradyarrhythmia   (sinus   and   AV   block),   and   proarrhythmia.

34

* Amiodarone    *   a   drug   that   spans   the   confines   of   just   one   drug

class.   Its   predominant   electrophysiologic   effect   is   to   prolong   the
refractory   period   of   atrial   and   ventricular   myocardium   and   the   AV
junction.   In   addition,   it   has   class   I   effects   (sodium
channel*blocking   properties),   some   class   II   effects   (β*  and
α-receptor   blockade),   and   some   class   IV   effects   (calcium   channel
blockade).   Amiodarone   is   used   to   treat   life-threatening   ventricular
arrhythmias   (rhythm   control)   and   atrial   fibrillation   (rate   control)   in
dogs   refractory   to   other,   more   common   treatments.   In   some
cases,   it   is   used   because   of   its   effectiveness   in   treatment   of   both
ventricular   and   supraventricular   arrhythmias.    It   is   rarely   used   as
a   first-line   drug.

* Long   half   life   in   dogs   of   3.2   days
* Because   it   has   β-blocking   effects   it   should   not   be

combined   with   other   β-blockers(eg, atenolol)   or   other
negative   inotropes   (eg, diltiazem).   In   addition,   it   should   not
be   combined   with   another   class   III   agent   (eg, sotalol).
* Use   as   Nexterone   if   giving   IV   since   IV   amiodarone   can
cause   anaphylaxis   reaction   (due   to   polysorbate   80)

* Adverse   effects   seem   to   be   related   to   dose   and   duration   of

treatment   and   include   significant   increases   in   liver
enzymes,   GI   signs,   thyroid   dysfunction,   blood   dyscrasias
(neutropenia),   and   proarrhythmia.   The   liver   effects   seem   to
be   the   most   common   adverse   effect   encountered   clinically
and   are   typically   reversible   after   cessation   of   therapy.
* The   oral   dosage   in   dogs   is   8*10   mg/kg,   PO,   once   to   twice
daily   for   7*10   days,   and   then   decreased   to   4*6   mg/kg/day
for   longterm   treatment;   the   parenteral   dosage   in   dogs   is
2*5   mg/kg,   IV,   infused   over   30*60   min.

* Class   IV   *   Calcium   channel   blockers

* Diltiazem

* Typically   indicated   for   treatment   of    atrial   fibrillation   (rate
control)   and   other   supraventricular   arrhythmias   in
dogs   and   cats.    Another   historical   indication   is   for
treatment   of   feline   hypertrophic   cardiomyopathy.   However,
limited   practicality   in   combination   with   its   unconfirmed
efficacy   for   feline   hypertrophic   cardiomyopathy   has   caused
diltiazem   to   fall   into   disfavor   for   this   indication.   Diltiazem
has   no   effect   on   ventricular   arrhythmias.

* Dosage

* Parenteral:   0.05*0.2   mg/kg,   IV,   over   5   min,   which

can   be   repeated   to   a   cumulative   dose   of   0.3   mg/kg,
after   which   the   dog   should   be   reassessed   or   an
oral   formulation   initiated

* Dogs,   oral   dose:

* Standard   oral   formulation:   0.5*2   mg/kg,   PO,

TID

35

* Sustained-release   formulation:   1*4   mg/kg,

PO,   BID
* Cats,   oral   dose:

* Standard   oral   formulation:   7.5   mg/cat,   PO,

TID

* Sustained-release   formulation:   30*60
mg/cat,   PO,   once   to   twice   daily.
* Initial   doses   should   be   at   the   lower   end   of   the   dose
range   and   titrated   up   to   a   clinically   effective   dose.
* Blood   pressure   and   heart   rate   and   rhythm   should

be   monitored   during   IV   administration.
* Dogs   and   cats   without   CHF   and   with   normal

systolic   function   can   tolerate   higher   initial   and
target   dosages.

* The   sustained-release   formulation   cannot   be   made
into   suspensions   but   can   be   reformulated   into
lower-dose   capsules.

* Possible   adverse   effects   include   systemic   hypotension,

negative   inotropy   and   bradycardia   (sinus   or   AV   block),   and
exacerbation   of   CHF.   GI   signs   are   the   common   noncardiac
adverse   effect   and   are   more   common   in   cats,   especially
with   sustained-release   preparations.

* DO   NOT   USE   CONCURRENTLY   WITH   A   BETA

BLOCKER

* Amlodipine    has   minimal   effects   on   cardiac   calcium   transport.

Primary   mechanism   of   action   is   on   the   vascular   smooth   muscle.
Save   this   puppy   for   treating   systemic   hypertension.

* The   antiarrhythmic   drug   that   knows   no   class

* Digoxin    *  decrease   sinus   discharge   rate,   depress   AV   node

conduction,   prolongs   AV   nodal   refractoriness,   depresses   atrial
automaticity,   enhances   intraatrial   conduction   velocity.

* Weak   positive   inotrope
* Toxicity   more   common   in   hypokalemic   state
* Half   life   :   14-56   hr   in   dogs,   23-43hrs   in   cats
* Can   take   5-7   days   before   reaching   peak   plasma

concentration

* Side   effects   include   GI   upset,   lethargy,   anorexia,   AV   block,

bundle   branch   block,   proarrhythmic

* If   side   effects   apparent,   consider   testing   Digoxin

plasma   levels   to   rule   out   toxicity

* It   is   administered   to   a   dose   of   0.005-0.01   mg/kg/12   hours
PO   route   or   0.22mg/m2/12   hours   by   PO   route   in   dogs   of
more   than   20   kg.

* Useful   for   atrial   fibrillation   (some   literature   supports   Digoxin

with   diltiazem   in   combination   is   better   to   slow   heart   rate   of
dogs   in   atrial   fibrillation   than   diltiazem   alone)   and
supraventricular   arrhythmias.

* Clinical   signs   *  hunched   posture,   palpable   spinal   pain,   stiff   gait   (especially   in

pelvic   limbs),   +/*  tetra   vs   paresis,   ataxia,   delayed   or   absent   CPs   in   the   affected
limbs

* Diagnostics

* Radiographs   *  may   see   narrowed/wedged   disc   spaces   or   mineralized

discs,   spondylosis,   other   evidence   of   trauma,   bony   neoplasia,   etc.;   pets
with   severe   hip   arthritis   can   sometimes   also   have   loss   of   normal   neuro
reflexes   in   pelvic   limbs

* CHEM/NSAID   panel   *  prior   to   prescribing   anti-inflammatories

* Treatment   options

* Pain   management   and   strict   rest

44

* Strict   cage   rest   for   2-8   weeks   depending   on   severity   of   signs
* Medications   *  anti-inflammatory   (steroids   vs   NSAIDs)   +   opioid   or

gabapentin   +/*  methocarbamol

* Recheck   in   2   weeks,   sooner   if   any   concern   of   loss   of   motor
* Acupuncture/rehabilitation/physical   therapy   if   available   in   your   area/client

interested

* Pursue   surgical   intervention   if   motor   is   lost

* Prognosis   *  good   to   excellent   with   strict   rest   and   pain   management

* Acutely   Down

* Common   history   *  see   above,   plus   unable   to   use/move   back   legs

pain   severe   paresis   to   paralysis   of   the   pelvic   limbs,   absent   CPs   pelvic   limbs,
minimal   to   absent   motor

* If   motor   is   absent,   check   for   superficial   pain.   If   absent,   check   for   deep

pain.   Remember   to   differentiate   between   pain   response   and   withdrawal.

* Diagnostics

* Myelogram
* Ideally   CT   or   MRI   (generally   CT   better   for   disc   extrusion,   MRI   better   for

other   causes)   in   preparation   for   surgery

* Treatment   options

* If   losing   motor   function   or   motor   is   lost,   surgery   is   recommended.
* If   surgery   is   not   an   option,   can   try   strict   rest   and   medications   (see   above
in   back   pain)   and   other   modalities   but   warn   owner   about   strong   potential
for   permanent   paralysis

* Acupuncture/physical   therapy   if   surgery   cannot   be   pursued

* Prognosis   *  varied

* If   losing   deep   pain   and   surgery   is   not   pursued   within   48   hours,   prognosis

is   extremely   poor   for   return   to   function

* Good   prognosis   if   surgery   pursued   after   motor   is   lost   but   before

superficial   pain   is   lost

* Always   warn   owners   that   neurologic   status   could   be   worse   after   surgery

* Seizures

* Increased   abnormal   electrical   activity   in   the   brain
* Potential   causes   *  epilepsy   (idiopathic),   neoplasia,   inflammatory,   infectious,

vascular,   trauma,   toxin,   metabolic,   congenital

* Common   history   *  visualized   seizure   activity,   behavior   changes   at   home

(post-ictal   vs   intracranial   disease)

* Stages

muzzle,   ears,   eyelids)   or   limbs,   +/*  loss   or   change   of   consciousness

* Diagnostics

* CBC/CHEM/UA   *  rule   out   toxic/metabolic   and   other   causes   of   seizures;

will   likely   be   normal   in   cases   of   epilepsy

* If   hypoglycemic,   consider   insulin:glucose   ratio   to   rule   in/out

insulinoma

normal   diagnostics   (if   owner   willing   to   do),   then   no   medication   necessary
at   that   time

* Medications   warranted   if   pet   is   having   2+   seizures   in   a   6   week   period   or   if
cluster   seizures   (2+   seizures   in   a   24   hr   period)   are   occurring,   seizures   are
lasting   >5   minutes,   post-ictal   period   is   prolonged/patient   not   recovering
normally

* Stop   active   seizures   with   benzodiazepine

* Diazepam   0.5-2   mg/kg   IV   or   rectal   if   IV   access   cannot   be   gained;

for   smaller   pets

* Cats

* 20   mg/kg   IV   q8hrs
* PO   dose   20   mg/kg   PO   q8-12hrs

* Recommend   once   daily   BG   check   and   PE   by   veterinarian

* Prognosis:   varies   and   depends   on   duration   of   illness,   level   of   medical   care

provided,   concurrent   illnesses,   complicating   factors,   vaccination   history,   and   age
of   patient

Endocrine

* Insulin   Overdose/Hypoglycemia

* Occurs   with   accidental   insulin   overdose   or   when   animals   have   not   eaten/vomits
* Clinical   signs   *  weakness,   dull   mentation,   ataxia,   seizures
* Treatment

* Owners   can   put   karo   syrup   or   honey   on   gums   while   coming   to   the

hospital

* Can   give   oral   dextrose   until   IV   access   is   gained

57

* Stop   all   insulin   administration   until   hyperglycemia   returns
* Give   dextrose   via   bolus   and   then   in   IVF   @   5%
* Offer   food   when   pet   able   to   eat
* Monitor   BGs   q2-4hrs   depending   on   clinical   signs

* Prognosis   *  good   with   appropriate   intervention
* If   you   have   concurrent   refractory   hypoglycemia   despite   dextrose

supplementation   *  concern   for   insulinoma   *  pull   insulin:glucose   ratio   with   BG   is
<40

* Diabetic   Ketoacidosis   (DKA)

* Occur   in   either   previously   undiagnosed   diabetics   or   poorly   regulated   diabetics

due   absolute   lack   or   severe   deficiency   of   insulin

* Concurrent/inciting   issues   that   can   contribute   to   DKA   include   pancreatitis,

cholangiohpatitis,   Cushing’s   (hyperadrenocorticism),   bacterial   infections,   other
inflammatory   and   infectious   conditions,   hypothyroidism,   renal   failure,   excessive
sex   hormones,   glucagon-secreting   tumors,   pheochromocytoma

* Clinical   signs   *  can   present   as   very   ill   (vomiting,   diarrhea,   severe   dehydration,

laterally   recumbent,   anorexia)   or   more   consistent   with   diabetics   (PU/PD)   or   may
appear   healthy

* Diagnostics

* CBC:   +/*  leukocytosis/neutrophilia,   +/*  anemia

* Blood   gas:    acidosis
* Serum   ketones   can   be   checked   as   well   as   urine   ketones
* Abdominal   ultrasound   *  evaluate   pancreas   for   pancreatitis,   kidneys   for

pyelonephritis,   ileus,   rule   out   foreign   body,   etc.

* Treatment

* Rehydration/fluid   therapy

* Incredibly   important   in   DKAs
* Used   to   recommend   0.9%   NaCl   but   now   recommend   P-Lyte   or

NormR   (LRS   less   appropriate   because   lower   amount   of
potassium/magnesium)

* Correct   hypotension   with   fluid   boluses
* Correct   dehydration   over   24   hours

* Pets   need   a   least   1.5-2x   maintenance,   however   best   to

calculate   fluid   deficit   and   correct

* Will   likely   need   to   supplement   potassium   and   phosphorous

* Losses   through   vomiting,   anorexia,   and   through   urine
* K+   and   Phos   are   driven   lower   when   insulin   instituted
* Usually   range   of   20-40   mEq   KCl

* Can   do   20   mEq   KCl   and   20   mEq   KPHos   for

example   (adjust   accordingly)

58

* Check   potassium   scale   in   fluid   therapy   section   if

needed

* Acid/base   status   will   generally   improve   with   fluid   therapy

* In   rare   cases,   will   need   to   supplement   bicarb   *  talk   to   your

criticalist!

* Insulin   CRI

* When   to   start?   Prior   literature   recommended   waiting   at   least   6

hours   to   start   CRI   to   allow   for   rehydration.   Newer   reports   indicate
that   there   is   no   major   difference   in   waiting   versus   starting   sooner.
(For   me,   I   generally   wait   4-6   hours   before   starting   the   CRI   so   I   can
correct   any   hypotension).   If   you   have   an   IMED   or   ECC   specialist
at   your   hospital,   discuss   with   them   what   they   prefer/recommend

* DOG:

* Insulin   CRI   *   2.2   U/kg   units   regular   insulin   in   250   ml   of

0.9%   saline,   adjust   as   follows:

* If   BG   >250,   insulin   CRI   at   10   ml/hour,   no   dextrose

in   IV   fluids

* If   BG   =   200-250,   insulin   CRI   at   7   ml   hour,   2.5%

* If   BG   =   100-199,   insulin   CRI   at   5   ml/hour,   2.5%

dextrose   in   IV   fluids

* If   BG   <100,   D/C   insulin,   5%   dextrose   in   IV   fluids

* *  Notify   DVM   if   BG   is   >   250   for   more   than   6   hours   (DVM   to

increase   insulin   CRI   by   25%)

* *  If   BG   is   <100,   stop   insulin   CRI   until   BG   >   80,   restart

insulin   CRI   with   25%   reduction   from   prior   rate.

* *  Once   dextrose   is   added   to   fluids,   do   not   remove   it   until

patient   is   eating   adequately.

* *  Discontinue   insulin   CRI   based   on   nutritional   status   of

patient   and   BG   level.   If   glycemic   control   is   achieved   and
patient   is   eating,   CRI   may   be   discontinued   and   intermittent
long   acting   insulin   therapy   initiated   even   if   the   ketone   level
is   still   positive   (moderate   to   slight)

* CAT:

* Insulin   CRI   *   1.1   U/kg   units   regular   insulin   in   250   ml   of

0.9%   saline,   adjust   as   follows:

* If   BG   >250,   insulin   CRI   at   5   ml/hour,   no   dextrose   in

IV   fluids

* If   BG   =   200-250,   insulin   CRI   at   4   ml   hour,   2.5%

dextrose   in   IV   fluids

* If   BG   =   150-199,   insulin   CRI   at   3   ml/hour,   2.5%

dextrose   in   IV   fluids

59

* If   BG   =   100-149,   insulin   CRI   at   2   ml/hour,   2.5%

dextrose   in   IV   fluids

* If   BG   <100,   D/C   insulin,   5%   dextrose   in   IV   fluids

* *  Notify   DVM   if   BG   is   >   250   for   more   than   6   hours   (DVM   to

increase   insulin   CRI   by   25%)

* *  If   BG   is   <100,   stop   insulin   CRI   until   BG   >100,   restart

insulin   CRI   with   25%   reduction   from   prior   rate.

* *  Once   dextrose   is   added   to   fluids,   do   not   remove   it   until

patient   is   eating   adequately.

* *  Discontinue   insulin   CRI   based   on   nutritional   status   of

patient   and   BG   level.   If   glycemic   control   is   achieved   and
patient   is   eating,   CRI   may   be   discontinued   and   intermittent
long   acting   insulin   therapy   initiated   even   if   the   ketone   level
is   still   positive   (moderate   to   slight)

* One   patient   is   eating,   can   switch   to   appropriate   long   acting   insulin

* Broad   spectrum   antibiotics   if   warranted

* Patients   many   times   have   concurrent   infections   (UTI,   pneumonia,

etc)

* Ampicillin,   unasyn,   enrofloxacin,   etc.
* Metronidazole   or/and   probiotic   for   diarrhea

* Gastroprotectants

* Maropitant,   ondansetron,   metoclopramide   (if   foreign   body   ruled

out)

* Famotidine   or   pantoprazole   for   antacid   (keep   in   mind

pantoprazole   can   contribute   to   diarrhea   in   some   cases)

* Pain   management

* If   pancreatitis/concurrent   abdominal   discomfort   present,   can   use

available   opioids   *  keep   in   mind,   opioids   can   contribute   to   ongoing
nausea   and   ileus   which   may   contribute   to   anorexia   in   the   animal

* Monitoring

* Check   acid/base/potassium/electrolytes   q12hrs   (more   frequently   in

severely   debilitated   patients)

* Check   phosphorous   and   magnesium   q24hrs
* Check   ketones   q24hrs
* Blood   pressure   PRN

* Prognosis

* Variable
* Prepare   owners   that   their   pet   could   be   in   the   hospital   easily   for   3-5   days
or   longer,   and   that   treatment   can   become   very   expensive   (in   Virginia   we
average   about   $4000   per   DKA).   Also   owners   needed   to   be   prepared   for
the   long   term   care   of   a   diabetic.

* Addison’s   Disease/Hypoadrenocorticism

* Primary   vs   Secondary

60

* Primary   *  destruction   of   the   adrenal   cortex   leading   to   lack   of   appropriate

levels   of   glucocorticoids   and   mineralcorticoids

* Characterized   by   hyperkalemia   and   hyponatremia   because

mineralcorticoids   help   regulate   sodium,   potassium,   and   water
homeostasis

* Most   common   type   of   in   dogs   (immune   mediated)

* Secondary   *  decreased   ACTH   production   from   either   destructive   lesion   of
the   pituitary   or   iatrogenic   causes   (steroid   cream)   leading   to   deficiency   in
glucocorticoid   but   not   mineralcorticoid

* “Atypical”   Addisonian’s

* Clinical   signs

* “The   Great   Pretender”   *  can   really   present   any   way   it   wants   to
* Usually   in   young   to   middle   aged   females
* Vomiting,   diarrhea,   anorexia,   lethargy,   weight   loss
* Dehydration,   collapse,   hypovolemic   shock,   PU/PD,   bradycardia

* Diagnostics

* CBC   *  no   stress   leukogram;   non-regenerative   anemia   can   be   present   but

masked   by   dehydration;   +/*  lymphocytosis

* CHEM

* Hyperkalemia,   hyponatremia,   hypochloremia   (occurs   due   to

decreased   aldosterone)

* Normal   Na/K   =   27:1-40:1
* Addison’s   Na/K=   <27:1

* Elevated   BUN

* Can   be   from   dehydration   (pre-renal)   or   from   GI

hemorrhage   (commonly   seen)
* Hypercalcemia   (pathophys   unknown)
* Liver   changes

* Hypoalbuminemia
* Hypocholesterolemia
* Elevated   liver   enzymes
* Microhepatica
* Hypoglycemia   *  occurs   secondary   to   lack   of   glucocorticoids

* Fecal   *  rule   out   whipworms   as   other   potential   cause   of   clinical   signs
* Baseline   cortisol   *  great   way   to   rule   in/out   concerns   about   Addison’s,

inexpensive   for   owners

* Snap   test   *  if   <0.5   concerning   for   Addison’s,   run   ACTH   stim;   if   >2,

then   likely   not   Addison’s

* ACTH   stimulation   test

* Will   help   confirm   diagnosis   of   Addison’s   but   will   not   differentiate

which   type

61

* Serum   cortisol   concentrations   are   measured   before   and   one   hour

after   administration   of   5ug/kg   cosyntropin   (Cortrosyn)
intravenously

* It   is   OK   to   give   Dexamethasone   while   doing   ACTH   stim,   will   not

affect   the   results

* Treatment

* Fluid   therapy

* Correct   hypovolemia
* Classically   treated   with   0.9%   NaCl,   however   more   recent

suggestions   recommend   LRS,   NormR   or   P-lyte   to   avoid   raising
sodium   too   quickly

* Serum   potassium   should   correct   quickly   with   fluid   therapy.

However   if   it   does   not,   recommend   giving   calcium   gluconate   to
protect   the   heart   and   dextrose/insulin   to   help   drive   potassium
intracellularly   (see   urethral   obstruction   section   for   doses)

* Correct   hypoglycemia   with   dextrose   boluses   and   2.5%-5%   in   IVF

(remember   not   to   bolus   dextrose!)

* Monitor   electrolytes/BG   q4-6   hours   until   everything   has   normalized
* Steroids!

* Dexamethasone   SP   *  will   not   affect   ACTH   stim

* 0.1   mg/kg   IV   q24hrs

* Can   transition   to   oral   steroids   once   patient   is   able   to   take   oral

medications

* Prednisone   0.5-1mg/kg/day,   divided   BID.   Start   with   1

mg/kg/day   and   then   decrease   to   0.5   mg/kg/day   after   24-48
hours.

* Keep   in   mind   that   if   prednisone   is   given   before   a

baseline   cortisol   or   ACTH   stim   has   been
performed,   those   tests    cannot    be   performed   for   a
minimum   of   12-hours   due   to   cross-reactivity   of   the
prednisone/prednisolone   with   cortisol   on   the   assay.

* Mineralocorticoids

* Desoxycorticosterone   pivalate   (DOCP):   2.2   mg/kg   IM   q25   -28

days

* Can   be   given   safely   while   waiting   for   ACTH   stim   to   return

* Florinef   (fludrocortisone):   0.02   mg/kg   PO   divided   BID

* Prognosis   *  good   with   early   intervention   and   appropriate   long   term   management

Repro

* Dystocia

* Normal   stages   of   parturition

* Stage   I   labor   *  uterine   contractions   start,   but   not   visible   externally;   cervix

begins   to   dilate

* Common   signs   (canine):   behavior   changes   (panting,   pacing,

nesting,   shivering,   hiding),   anorexia,   and   vomiting.   Clear,   watery
vaginal   discharge   may   occur.   Rectal   temp   drop   of   >1°F.
* Common   signs   (feline):   behavior   changes   (restless,   purring,

scratching   the   nesting   box,   pacing,   excessive   grooming).   Rectal
temp   drop   of   >1°F.

* Typical   timeframe:   6-24   hrs   in   length

* Stage   II   labor   *  fetuses   start   moving   through   birth   canal
* Common   signs:   abdominal   contractions
* Typical   timeframe:   pups   or   kittens   usually   delivered   q30-60   min,

but   up   to   3   hrs   between   can   be   normal.   Entire   stage   can   last   up   to
24hrs,   but   is   typically   shorter

* Stage   III   labor   *  passage   of   fetal   membranes,   can   occur   concurrently   with

Stage   II;   retained   fetal   membranes   are   rare

* When   is   it   considered   a   dystocia?
* Prolonged   gestation

12-24hrs   post   progesterone   drop   to   <2   ng/mL)

* Feline:   >68   days   post-mating

* No   fetus   delivered   for   >24hrs   after   onset   of   stage   I   labor
* Stage   II   abdominal   contractions   with   no   birth   in   30-60   min   or   >3-4   hrs

between   delivery   of   subsequent   fetuses

* Fetal   membrane   visible   for   15   minutes   or   longer   or   presence   of   immobile

fetus   in   birth   canal

* Excessive   or   abnormal   vaginal   discharge   (green,   black,   hemorrhagic,   or

purulent)

* More   than   24   hours   of   labor   to   deliver   entire   litter
* Weak   or   infrequent   labor   contractions,   crying   or   biting   at   flank   or   vulva

* Causes

* Maternal:   primary   uterine   inertia   (failure   to   initiate   parturition   at   term;

typically   only   1-2   pups),   secondary   uterine   inertia   (contractions   stop   after
parturition   has   started;   typically   large   litters   or   bitches/queens   in   poor
body   condition),   brachycephalic   breeds,   dolichocephalic   cats,
conformational   issues   (obesity,   historical   pelvic   trauma,   congenital
abnormalities),   fear   or   pain

65

* Neonatal:   abnormalities   in   presentation,   position,   posture,   size,   or   due   to

the   presence   of   developmental   defects

* Diagnosis

* Patient   may   appear   healthy   and   stable   or   critically   ill
* Digital   vaginal   exam

* Feel   for   fetus   or   signs   of   obstruction
* Ferguson   reflex   *  apply   pressure   on   dorsal   vaginal   vault   to   induce

contractions

* Can   restart   labor
* Diagnostic   test:   no   contractions   =   uterine   inertia;   medical

therapy   may   not   be   successful

* Ultrasound   *  best   tool   to   assess   fetal   distress   and   viability

* Normal   fetal   heart   rates:   >180-220bpm

* Fetal   distress:   160-180bpm
* Immediate   emergency,   take   to   c-section:   <160bpm

* Abdominal   radiographs   *  assess   number   of   remaining   fetuses
* Progesterone   assay

* Progesterone   level   of   2.0   ng/mL   is   necessary   to   support

pregnancy

* Treatment

* Manipulate   Manually

* Position   bitch   in   standing   position
* Use   a   liberal   amount   of   lubricant   and   gauze   sponges   to

manipulate   fetus

* Gentle   traction   in   ventral   and   posterior   direction,   do   not   pull   on   jaw

or   extremities,   may   help   to   turn   fetus   side   to   side

* Medical   Management

* Appropriate   for   mild   cases,   when   birth   canal   is   not   obstructed,
bitch   or   queen   is   not   systemically   ill,   and   there   are   no   other
apparent   issues   that   would   prohibit   vaginal   delivery

* Monitor   heart   rate   and   rhythm

* Admin   Oxytocin   *  induces   and   enhances   uterine   contractions,   milk

ejection

* Dose:   0.25-2.0   IU   IM   or   SC   (max   4   IU)
* Can   repeat   in   30-60   min   for   two   total   doses
* Intermittently   perform   vaginal   exams   and   feathering
* If   a   fetus   is   delivered,   wait   an   hour   to   see   if   another   will   be

delivered.   If   no   fetus   is   delivered,   perform   c-section.

66

* Surgery   *  Cesarean   section

* Most   anesthesia   protocols   recommend   short-acting   induction
agents   (i.e.,   propofol,   alfaxalone)   and   limiting   sedatives   until
fetuses   are   out

* Contraindicated:   ketamine,   xylazine,   medetomidine,   and

acepromazine

* Adequate   pain   control   is   necessary

* If   opioid   used:   Naloxone   can   be   used   if   neonate

shows   signs   of   respiratory   depression   after   delivery

* OVH   if   medically   indicated   or   breeder   requests
* Decreasing   neonatal   loss:   rapid   dystocia   diagnosis   and   treatment,

IV   fluids   and   pre-oxygenate   bitch   prior   to   surgery,   limiting
anesthesia   time,   and   PRN   neonatal   resuscitation

* Neonates

* Neonatal   Reflexes

* Suckle   reflex:   place   finger   in   mouth   of   neonate
* Rooting   reflex:   cup   hand   around   muzzle   of   neonate
* Eliciting   squeal:    rub   over   lumbar   region
* Righting   reflex:    place   onto   back,   should   make   efforts   to   right   self
* Pinching   toes   should   stimulate   neonate   to   bob   its   head

* Neonatal/Fetal   Resuscitation

* Oxygen   is   most   important   *  flow-by   vs   positive   pressure   ventilation

w/mask

* Wipe   nasal   passages,   use   bulb   syringe   to   clean   secretions   out   of   nasal

passages   and   oral   cavity

* Stimulate   neonate   by   rubbing   gently   with   clean,   warm   towel

* Thoracic   wall,   rectal,   nasal,   genital,   and   periumbilical   stimulation
* Acupuncture   point   (stimulate   respiration):   insert   25g   needle   at

nasal   philtrum,   twist   in   clockwise   direction

* Keep   neonate   warm
* Drug   therapy   (if   prolonged   or   unsuccessful   resuscitation)

* Dextrose   50%   *  one   drop   transbucally

* Helps   w/respiratory   and   cardiac   muscle   contractions
* Epinephrine   *  one   drop   transbucally   or   via   IV   or   IO   catheter
* If   bradycardic   despite   O 2    and   dextrose   therapy

* Naloxone   *  one   drop   transbucally

* To   reverse   opioid-induced   respiratory   depression

* NOT   recommended:

* Atropine   *  ineffective   due   to   neonatal   physiology   and

hypoxic   myocardium

* Doxapram   *  only   appropriate   to   reverse   effects   of
barbiturates   (phenobarbital,   etc),   otherwise   not

* Open   fontanel
* Urogenital   abnormalities

Toxicities

* Always   recommend   owners   call   ASPCA   animal   poison   control   *  (888)   426-4435   *  advise

owners   there   is   a   $75   fee   when   they   call

* Doses   to   know:

* Apomorphine   0.03-0.05   mg/kg   IV   to   induce   vomiting   in   dogs;   dexmedetomidine   7

mcg/kg   IM   in   cats   (works   about   ⅔   of   the   time   for   me)
* Maropitant   1   mg/kg   SQ/IV   after   vomiting   has   resolved

* Marijuana

* Pathophys   *   Cannabinoids   interact   with   cannabinoid   receptors   in   the   nervous   and

immune   systems,   leading   to   CNS   alterations

* More   significant   toxicosis   occurs   with   ingestion   of   edibles/plant   versus

more   mild   toxicosis   with   second   hand   smoke

* Clinical   signs

* Quiet   to   dull   mentation,   ataxia,   hyperesthesia,   bradycardia   (sometimes
tachycardia),   hypothermia,   vomiting,   ptyalism,   dribbling   urine,   mydriasis
(sometimes   miosis),   tremors;   rarely   seizures

* In   severe   cases   *  obtunded   to   comatose

* Diagnostics

* Diagnosis   generally   made   off   of   history   (if   owners   will   admit   to   it)   and

clinical   signs

* Can   try   a   urine   drug   test,   but   not   necessarily   accurate   *  rare   to   have   false

positives   but   common   to   have   false   negatives

* Treatment

* If   seizures   present

* Midazolam/diazepam,   Keppra,   phenobarbital,   propofol   (see

seizure   section)

* Generally   inducing   vomiting   is   not   an   option   since   CNS   too   effected   and

risk   of   aspiration   pneumonia   high

* If   can   safely   administer   activated   charcoal,   can   consider   this   1-5   gram/kg,

only   if   patient   can   safely   swallow

* IV   fluids
* Heat   support   as   needed
* Antiemetics   *  maropitant

68

* IV   lipids   in   severe   cases   (comatose,   unknown   amount   of   ingestion

occurred)

* 1.5   mL/kg   bolus   followed   by   0.25   mL/kg/min   x   30-60   min
* Check   serum   for   hyperlipemia   before   repeating

* Many   times   owners   cannot   afford/not   interested   in   hospitalization

* Recommend   SQ   fluids,   maropitant,   and   keeping   the   pet   somewhere

quiet,   dark,   and   warm   until   clinical   signs   resolve

* Edibles

* THC   content   can   have   extreme   variation   amongst   edibles
* Many   times   if   a   chocolate   edible,   the   chocolate   and   marijuana   will   help

counteract   each   other   somewhat

* The   only   time   I   have   ever   had   to   give   lipids   is   with   small   patients   who

ingested   high   concentration   edibles

* Prognosis   *  good;   warn   owners   it   could   take   1-3   days   for   clinical   signs   to
completely   resolve,   but   should   be   seeing   progressive   improvement

* Chocolate

* Most   common   food   toxicity   in   dogs
* Toxic   component   *  methylxanthines   (theobromine   and   caffeine)
* Clinical   signs   *  occur   within   1-4   hours   of   ingestion

* GI   signs   *  vomiting   and   diarrhea
* Cardiac   *  tachycardia

* GI   *  20   mg/kg
* Arrhythmias   *  40-50   mg/kg
* Seizures   *  50-60   mg/kg
* VIN   has   a   chocolate   toxicity   calculator,   as   does   Merck   which   can   be

helpful   in   determining   treatment   moving   forward

* Treatment

* Induce   vomiting   *  may   not   be   necessary   if   pet   has   vomited   a   large

amount   of   chocolate   prior   to   coming   in

* Activated   charcoal   (per   ASPCA   toxicologists,   some   are   still

recommended   charcoal   while   some   are   moving   away   from   it)

* Usually   0.5-1   gram/kg;   first   dose   with   sorbitol,   following   doses
without.   Normally   do   not   need   more   than   2-4   doses   total

* Seizures   can   be   controlled   with   diazepam/midazolam
* Fluid   therapy
* Monitor   ECG/BP,   treat   arrhythmias   accordingly
* Treatment   is   usually   anywhere   from   12-24   hours

* Prognosis   is   good

* Xylitol

* Sweetener   *  seen   in   baked   goods,   sugar   free   gum,   vitamins

* Emesis   if   just   occurred   and   patient   asymptomatic
* Hospitalize   for   72   hours   on   IVF
* Monitor   BG   frequently   q1-4hrs
* Treat   hypoglycemia   with   dextrose   boluses   (50%   dextrose,   1   mL/kg,

diluted   1:1   with   saline)   and   adding   dextrose   to   IVF

* If   going   higher   than   7.5%   in   IVF,   will   need   central   line

* Feed   small   meals   frequently
* Recheck   chemistry   at   24,   48,   and   72   hours
* Treat   elevated   liver   values   with   hepatoprotectants   (per   ASPCA,   generally

do   N-acetylcysteine   or   Denamarin)

* N-acetylcysteine   (140*280   mg/kg   loading   dose   IV,   PO;   followed
by   70   mg/kg   qid),   vitamin   K1   (1.25*2.5   mg/kg   PO   bid),   plasma,
SAMe   (20   mg/kg/day   PO),   vitamin   E   (100*400   IU   bid   PO)   and
silymarin   (20*50   mg/kg/day   PO)

* If   giving    N-acetylcysteine    PO,   dilute   to   5%   solution   -

decreases   chance   of   mucosal   irritation   and   ulceration

* If   ALT   >1000,   check   PT/PTT.   If   PT/PTT   prolonged,   consider   FFP

transfusion

PT   will   be   prolonged

* PIVKA   (Protein   Induced   by   Vitamin   K   Absence   or   Antagonists)

* Will   be   prolonged
* Detects   a   build   up   of   nonfunctional   clotting   factor

precursors

* Bromethalin

* MOA   *  uncouples   oxidative   phosphorylation   (Krebs   Cycle)   →   leads   to
depletion   of   ATP   →   inhibits   the   Na/K   ATPase   →    intramyelinic   edema
develops   →    causes   decreased   nerve   impulse   conduction

* Clinical   signs

* Prognosis   *  good   with   early   intervention,   poor   if   CNS   signs   are   occurring

* Cholecalciferol   (Vitamin   D3)

* MOA   *  conversion   of   cholecalciferol   into   calcitriol   →   absorption   of   calcium
from   the   GI   tract/bone/kidneys   →    profound   hypercalcemia.   This   causes
acute   renal   failure,   arrhythmias   and   in   some   cases   heart   failure,
mineralization   of   tissues

* Clinical   signs

* Vomiting,   diarrhea,   hyporexia,   polyuria,   polydipsia,   arrhythmias,

lethargy,   weakness

temperature,   strenuous   exercise,   or   severe   tremors/seizures;   animal   cannot
dissipate   heat   effectively   to   cool   itself   (reminder,   animals   use   evaporation   and
conduction   as   main   ways   for   heat   dissipation)

* Pathophysiology

* Marked   elevated   temperature   leads   to   coagulopathies,   inflammatory

conditions,   and   tissue   dysregulation   leading   to   multiorgan
disruption/failure

* Anything   above   109F   leads   to   alteration   at   the   cellular   level   (normal   cell

membrane   stability   and   enzyme   activity   are   disrupted)

* Cardiovascular   →   systemic   hypoperfusion,   cardiac   arrhythmias
* Renal   →   AKI
* Coagulation   →   thrombocytopenia,   DIC

* ***Keep   in   mind   that   some   owners   begin   active   cooling   prior   to

presentation   which   may   bring   this   down   to   normal   by   the   time   your
pet   gets   to   the   clinic

others   24   and   only   longer   if   urine   significantly   hematuric/gritty)

* Consider   pulling   u-cath   when   urine   quality   normal,   non-azotemic,   etc.
* If   third   offense,   recommend   PU   surgery

* Wounds

* Types

* Clean   *  atraumatic   (aka   aseptic   surgical   incision)
* Clean-contaminated   *  minimal   contamination,   easily   remedied   (aka

enterotomy,   cystotomy)

* Contaminated   *  recent   wound   from   trauma   with   bacterial   contamination

(aka   bite   wounds,   vehicular   trauma,   GI   perforation,   etc.)

* Infected   *  older   wound,   obviously   infected

* Phases   of   healing

* Inflammation   (days   0-5)
* Debridement   (occurs   basically   at   the   same   time   as   inflammation)
* Repair/proliferation   aka   granulation   tissue   and   epithelialization   (starts   day

3-5,   lasts   2-4   weeks)

* Maturation   *  wound   contraction   and   remodeling   (days   17-20   post   injury,

can   last   years)

* Basic   wound   care

* Assess   response   to   antibiotics   (or   need   for   antibiotics)
* Debride   and   lavage   with   sterile   technique
* Assess   for   primary   closure
* Protect   wounds   as   necessary   (e-collar,   bandages,   etc.)

* Cleaning   wounds

* Chlorhexidine   or   betadine   scrub   on   healthy   skin   around   the   wound
* Lavage   the   wound   itself   with   sterile   saline,   LRS,   or   dilute   chlorhexidine

solution

(re)culture

* Bandages

* Wet-to-dry   bandages   *  generally   sterile   saline,   although   there   are   a

variety   of   moist   wound   dressing   products   out   there

* Change   every   1-3   days   depending   on   contamination   of   wound,   or

if   there   is   strike-thru

* Honey   bandages

* Manuka   honey
* Change   every   24   hours   or   if   there   is   strike-thru

* Consider   placing   a   tie-over   bandage   over   large   wounds   that   cannot   be

closed

* Place   individual   suture   loops   around   wound   in   normal   skin
* Apply   appropriate   wound   dressing,   then   padding   (lap   sponges,

gauze,   etc),   then   drape   material

* Use   umbilical   tape   and   lace   through   the   various   suture   loops   over

the   drape   to   secure   the   bandage   and   padding   down

* Change   every   1-3   days   depending   on   contamination   of   wound,   or

if   there   is   strike-thru

* Remind   clients   that   any   bandage   needs   to   stay   dry!

* Bite   wounds

* Type   of   injury:   shearing,   tensile,   compressive   *  leads   to   avulsion   of   skin

and   underlying   tissue,   crushing   injuries,    punctures,   fractures

* All   bite   wounds   should   be   considered   contaminated
* Keep   in   mind,   multiple   bite   wounds/infected   bite   wounds   can   lead   to

sepsis   and/or   SIRS

* If   there   are   bite   wounds   over   the   thorax   or   abdomen   with   any   chance   of
penetration   into   the   cavities,   then   surgical   exploration   should   ideally   be
pursued

* Debride   all   necrotic   tissue
* Lavage   copiously
* Drains

* Some   people   use   them,   some   people   do   not
* Can   be   gravity   dependent   (penrose,   etc.)   or   closed   suction   (JP,

etc.)

* Should   exit   through   separate   stab   incision   in   the   sterile   field
* Remove   in   3-5   days,   depending   on   amount   of   production

occurring

90

* Consider   delayed   primary   closure   if   there   is   not   enough   viable   tissue   to

close

* Clavamox   ideal   antibiotic,   otherwise   penicillin   +   aminoglycoside   or

2nd-gen   cephalosporin   +   fluoroquinolone

* Wounds   should   be   monitored   closely   for   evidence   of   necrosis
* Always   warn   owners   about   the   potential   for   the   wound   to   “declare”   itself
within   the   first   few   days   after   the   initial   assault,   and   the   potential   for   the
wound   to   need   a   revision

* Allergic   Reactions

* Acute   local   hypersensitivity   reaction
* Can   be   caused   by   vaccines,   insect   stings,   environmental   allergens,   food,   other

medications/drugs;   many   times   no   history   of   exposure   to   any   stimuli

* Clinical   Signs   *  erythema,   pruritus,   urticaria   (hives);   common   to   see   on   the

periocular   areas,   muzzle/face,   ears;   can   see   hives   along   any   part   of   the   body

* Diagnostics

hours   and   to   have   the   pet   reevaluated   if   these   occur

* Anaphylaxis

* Acute   systemic   hypersensitivity   reaction
* Can   be   caused   by   vaccines,   insect   stings,   environmental   allergens,   food,   other

* Monitor   BGs   if   hypoglycemic
* Recumbent   care   as   needed

* Prognosis   *  variable

* Snake   Envenomation

* In   America,   most   commonly   see   Crotalid   species   (rattlesnakes,   Copperhead,

water   moccasins)

* Clinical   signs   depend   on

* Size/age   of   victim,   amount   of   venom,   location   of   bite,   type   of   venom,   time

between   bite   and   start   of   medical   therapy

* Typically,   local   and   systemic   signs   develop   within   30   minutes   to   2   hours
but   onset   of   signs   may   be   delayed   for   up   to   8   hours   in   some   cases

* Most   common   to   see   bites   on   face   and   forelimbs

and   swelling   compared   to   copperhead   bites

* Mojave   rattlesnake   causes   neurotoxicity
* Neurotoxicity   more   common   in   cats   than   dogs

* Diagnostics

92

* CBC   *  anemia   or   hemoconcentration,   thrombocytopenia,   leukocytosis
* Blood   smear   *  echinocytes
* Chemistry   *  may   be   normal,   or   may   see   azotemia,   elevated   CK,   ALT,   AST,

hyperbilirubinemia

* UA   *  may   be   normal,   may   see   hematuria,   hemoglobinuria,   myoglobinuria
* PT/PTT   *  may   be   normal   or   may   be   prolonged
* BP   *  hypotension   common
* ECG   *  arrhythmias   can   occur   (V-tach   or   VPCs   most   common)

* Treatment

* Antivenin    *  only   proven   therapy
* Administered   IV
* Most   effective   when   administered   in   the   first   4   hours
* Various   types   out   there,   your   hospital   should   hopefully   have   in

stock   what   is   needed   for   your   area

* Most   are   given   over   an   hour   but   refer   to   your   specific

product

* Monitor   for   anaphylaxis

* If   occurs,   stop   transfusion,   give   diphenhydramine,   restart

transfusion   over   slower   rate

* Keep   cost   in   mind,   can   be   cost   prohibitive   for   some   clients

* Opioid   based   pain   medications

* Generally   start   with   methadone/hydro   injection,   then   continue

either   intermittent   injections   vs   fentanyl   CRI   depending   on   pain
level
* Fluid   therapy

* Many   times   hypotensive,   will   likely   require   bolus(es),   keep   IVF   on

1.5-2x   maintenance

* Wounds   do   not   need   to   be   debrided,   antibiotics   are   only   necessary   if

secondary   infection   occurrs   (not   common)

* Monitor   BPs,   ECGs
* Recheck   platelet/PT/PTT   q12hrs
* Corticosteroids,   NSAIDs,   and   heparin   are   contraindicated
* Go   home   with   oral   opioids   (tramadol,   codeine)

* Prognosis   *  generally   good

* With   copperhead   bites,   generally   do   very   well.   Many   times   we   do   not

need   to   administer   antivenin   and   only   do   so   based   on   if   the   location   of   the
bite   is   severe,   or   if   the   patient   already   has   changes   on   bloodwork.   I   can’t
think   of   a   single   copperhead   bite   in   the   past   4   years   I’ve   been   in   Virginia
that   did   not   go   home

* Rattlesnake   bites   require   early   intervention   with   antivenin   to   have   a   more
favorable   prognosis.   Anecdotally   from   when   I   worked   in   California,   I
would   say   the   prognosis   was   closer   to   70/30

* Porcupines

* Sedation/Anesthesia

* Sedate   with   butorphanol   or   dexmedetomidine   (depending   on   cardiac

status,   age,   etc.)   for   superficial   quills   (i.e.,   ones   that   are   not   in   the   mouth)

* For   bad   quill   cases,   anesthetize   fully   (typically   with   propofol   induction)

and   intubate.
* Tips   for   quill   removal:

* Pull   straight   out   with   a   good   pair   of   hemostats.
* Quills   that   are   wet   will   often   break,   so   don't   rush;   just   keep   good   traction

on   the   quill.

* Put   a   little   bit   of   water   in   the   dish   with   the   quills   as   it   keeps   them   from

sticking   to   everything   you   have.

* Warn   owner   that   you   likely   won't   get   them   all   and   that   the   dog   may   need   to   come

back   for   further   quill   removal.

* Usually   by   the   time   they   reach   the   office   some   have   already   broken   off

and   migrated   under   the   skin.

* Those   that   are   readily   palpable   can   be   extracted   with   some   local

anesthetic   and   a   small   cut   down,   but   they   can   be   elusive

Common   Emergency   Surgeries

* Lactate   *  <4   better   prognosis,   >4   worse   prognosis;   if   lactate   decreased   by

4   at   recheck   after   surgery,   better   prognosis

* CBC   *  normal   to   inflammatory   leukogram,   hemoconcentration;   in   severe

cases   can   see   thrombocytopenia

* CHEM   *  azotemia,   elevated   liver   values,   protein   changes
* Blood   gas   *  metabolic   acidosis,   hyperlactatemia
* PT/PTT   *  can   be   prolonged   in   cases   with   DIC
* Thoracic   radiographs   *  recommend   doing   prior   to   anesthesia   to   evaluate

for   cardiomegaly   and   neoplastic   processes

* ECG   *  cardiac   arrhythmias

* Treatment

* Immediate   stabilization

* Fluid   therapy

* Persistent   hyperlactatemia   higher   mortality   rate

* Hemoabdomen

* Generally   characterized   as   traumatic   vs   spontaneous/non-traumatic

* Traumatic

* Vehicular   trauma   and   other   blunt   force   trauma,   bleeding   from

organ   biopsy   sites,   failure   of   surgical   hemostasis

* For   traumatic   hemoabdomens,   generally   respond   well   to   initial
stabilization;   rare   for   surgical   intervention   to   be   necessary   -
pursued   in   those   cases   that   are   not   responsive   to   large   volume
resuscitation   and   where   continued   intra-abdominal   bleeding   is
occurring

* Any   penetrating   abdominal   trauma   should    have   surgery,

regardless   of   whether   hemorrhage   has   continued   or   resolved

* Non-traumatic/spontaneous

95

* Most   common   is   ruptured   intra-abdominal   masses   (spleen,   liver)
* Tearing   of   short   gastric   vessels   with   GDV,   anaphylaxis,   secondary

to   rodenticide   or   other   toxin

* If   history   fits   with   spontaneous/noplasia,   remember   ⅔   rule   (more

recent   literature   supports   that   this   may   be   closer   to   50/50)

* If   >10%   difference   between   abdominal/peripheral   or   if   peripheral

PCV   <20%,   then   will   likely   need   pRBC   transfusion   for   stabilization

* CBC   *  regenerative   vs   non-regenerative   anemia,   +/*  thrombocytopenia

(generally   from   consumption)

* PT/PTT   *  can   be   mildly   elevated   with   hemorrhage;   will   be   markedly

prolonged   with   vitamin   K   antagonist

* Lactate   *  elevated,   indication   of   poor   systemic   perfusion
* FAST   US:   confirm   abdominal   effusion,   many   times   can   see   large

cavitated   mass;   make   sure   to   evaluate   for   pericardial/pleural   effusion

* Abdominocentesis    *  frank,   non-clotting   blood
* ECG   *  can   see   ventricular   arrhythmias
* Thoracic   radiographs   *  rule   out   metastasis

* Treatment

* Different   places   have   different   preferences   *  some   prefer   attempted

* Can   place   abdominal   wrap   *  questionable   about   how   much

stabilization   it   provides

* Consider   Yunnan   Baiyao   *  Chinese   herbal   supplement   with

hemostatic   properties

* Surgery   to   remove   bleeding   mass   if   indicated

remaining   fluid   and   quantify   *  if   concern   for   pneumothorax   is   high   (chronic
fluid   build-up)   recommend   not   removing   all   fluid

* May   need   to   “hop”   intercostal   spaces   to   find   new   pocket   of   fluid   to   be

aspirated

* Echocardiogram   is   ideal   but   not   always   feasible
* FAST   US   *  confirm   pericardial   effusion,   +/*  visualize   mass   (right   atrium   -

HSA,   between   aorta/main   pulmonary   artery   *  heart   based)

* ***Just   because   not   obvious   mass   noted   does   not   mean   mass   is

not   present

* ***Large   fibrin   clot   can   look   similar   to   mass

* ECG   *  possible   ventricular   arrhythmias,   small   QRS   complexes,   electrical

alternans

* Thoracic   radiographs   *  globoid   cardiac   silhouette
* CBC   *  PCV   to   assess   anemia,   platelet   count   to   look   for   severe

thrombocytopenia

* PT/PTT   *  ideal   to   rule   out   coagulopathy
* ***Many   times   on   ER   these   guys   come   in   crashing   and   you   have   to   tap
them   before   any   of   the   above   diagnostics   can   be   performed   *  always
advise   owners   on   potential   risks   of   doing   procedure   without   diagnostics

* Procedure

* Ideally   stabilize   with   O2   and   fluid   bolus   prior   to   procedure   (since   will   be

removing   hopefully   large   volume   of   body)

* Mild   sedation   may   be   necessary/helpful   (butorphanol,   midazolam,

alfaxolone,   etc.;   avoid   acepromazine   and   alpha-2   agonists)

* Can   be   placed   in   sternal   or   lateral   recumbency   (I   far   prefer   sternal)
* Place   on   ECG   during   procedure
* Surgically   prep   the    right    side   of   the   thorax   between   2nd-8th   ribs
* Apex   of   heart   beat   can   be   palpated   between   4th-5th   ribs   *  or   can   use   US

guided   to   help

* Do   local   lidocaine   block   at   selected   location   prior   to   inserting   catheter
* Recommend   making   small   nick   through   skin   at   site   of   lidocaine   block   to

facilitate   catheter   insertion

* Insert   catheter   with   stylet   and   advance   slowly   into   the   thoracic   cavity   until

there   is   a   flash   of   fluid   in   the   hub

* Sometimes   you   can   feel   a   soft   pop   when   perforating   the

pericardium   (I’ve   gotten   in   the   habit   where   when   I’m   performing
these   I   actually   close   my   eyes   when   inserting   the   catheter   and   do
it   by   feel   *  I   can   almost   always   feel   the   pop   through   the
pericardium   when   I   do   this)

* Once   pericardium   has   been   penetrated,   advance   catheter/stylet   2-3   mm

further

* Remove   stylet   and   attach   collection   system   (three   way   stock   cock,

extension   set,   and   20-60cc   syringe)   and   remove   fluid   *  obtain   samples
and   then   quantify

102

* If   needle   has   advanced   into   the   heart,   will   get   clotting   blood
* If   you   feel   a   scratching   sensation,   is   likely   the   catheter   is   in   contact   with
the   heart   (may   also   see   VPCs   on   the   ECG)   *  remove   catheter   a   small
amount   until   this   does   not   occur   anymore

* Sometimes   pericardium   tears   and   fluid   is   released   into   the   pleural   space   -

this   is   fine!

* Patient   generally   feels   significantly   better   almost   immediately   after

pericardiocentesis   *  pink   MM,   BP   normalizes,   HR   normalizes,   respiratory
distress   resolves

* Monitor   for   recurrence   of   effusion   (can   happen   within   minutes   so   keep

close   eye   on   patient   for   first   12-24   hours)
