## Veterinary Emergency Protocol: Canine Chocolate Ingestion Toxicity

**Presenting Complaint:** Known or suspected ingestion of chocolate.

**Definition:** Chocolate toxicity in dogs is caused by the methylxanthines, primarily theobromine and caffeine, present in chocolate. These substances are toxic to dogs and can cause a range of clinical signs.

**Triage:**

1.  **Initial Assessment (within 1-2 minutes):**

    * **History:**

        * Type of chocolate ingested (dark, milk, white, baking).

        * Amount of chocolate ingested (weight in grams or ounces).

        * Time of ingestion.

        * Dog's weight.

        * Pre-existing conditions.

    * **Observation:**

        * Restlessness, hyperactivity

        * Vomiting

        * Diarrhea

        * Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)

        * Tremors

        * Seizures

        * Muscle rigidity

        * Ataxia (uncoordinated movement)

        * Hyperthermia (elevated body temperature)

    * **Cardiovascular:**

        * Tachycardia (rapid heart rate) - may be >120-140 bpm

        * Arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia)

    * **Respiratory:**

        * Tachypnea (rapid breathing)

    * **Neurologic:**

        * Hyperactivity

        * Tremors

        * Seizures

        * Ataxia

        * Depression (in severe cases)

2.  **Immediate Actions (0-5 minutes):**

    * **Decontamination (if ingestion within 2 hours):**

        * **Induce Emesis:**

            * If the dog is asymptomatic and ingestion is recent (within 2 hours), induce vomiting.

            * Contraindications to emesis:

                * Symptomatic patients (vomiting, tremors, seizures)

                * Pre-existing conditions (e.g., megaesophagus, laryngeal paralysis)

                * Ingestion of caustic substances

            * Agents:

                * 3% Hydrogen Peroxide: 1-2 ml/kg orally, maximum 45 ml. May repeat once after 10-15 minutes if no emesis.

                * Apomorphine (IV or conjunctival): 0.03-0.04 mg/kg IV.

        * **Activated Charcoal:**

            * Administer activated charcoal (1-5 g/kg orally) after emesis or if emesis is contraindicated.

            * May repeat activated charcoal administration every 4-6 hours.

    * **Establish IV Access:**

        * Place an intravenous catheter in the cephalic or saphenous vein.

    * **ECG:**

        * Place the patient on continuous ECG to monitor for arrhythmias.

    * **Oxygen Supplementation:**

        * Administer oxygen via mask, nasal cannula, or flow-by if the patient is symptomatic, especially if there are cardiovascular or neurological signs.

3.  **Stabilization (15-60 minutes):**

    * **Further Assessment:**

        * **Cardiovascular:** Reassess HR, pulse quality.

        * **Respiratory:** Evaluate respiratory rate and effort.

        * **Neurologic:** Monitor mentation, tremors, seizure activity.

        * **Temperature:** Assess rectal temperature.

    * **Diagnostics:**

        * **Blood Work:**

            * Serum biochemistry profile (electrolytes, renal values, liver enzymes).

            * Blood glucose: May be elevated.

            * Complete blood count (CBC).

        * **ECG:** Evaluate for arrhythmias (sinus tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia).

    * **Treatment:**

        * **Intravenous Fluids:**

            * Administer crystalloid fluids (e.g., lactated Ringer's solution, 0.9% saline) to maintain hydration and support cardiovascular function.

            * Adjust fluid rate based on patient needs.

        * **Anti-arrhythmic Therapy:**

            * For significant tachycardia or ventricular arrhythmias:

                * Lidocaine: 2-4 mg/kg IV bolus, followed by a 25-75 mcg/kg/min CRI.

        * **Seizure Control:**

            * If seizures occur:

                * Diazepam: 0.5-1 mg/kg IV.

                * Phenobarbital: 2-4 mg/kg IV slowly, may repeat to a total of 20 mg/kg.

                * Propofol: 2-6 mg/kg IV bolus, followed by a CRI (5-10 mg/kg/hr).

        * **Tremor Control:**

            * Methocarbamol: 50-220 mg/kg IV slowly

        * **Hyperthermia Management:**

            * If body temperature is >103°F (39.4°C):

                * Cooling measures: fans, cool water baths, ice packs.

                * Monitor temperature closely.

        * **Bladder Management:**

            * Place a urinary catheter to monitor urine output, especially if using IV fluids and diuretics.

        * **Gastroprotectants:**

            * H2 antagonists (Famotidine) or proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole)

        * **Supportive care:**

            * Quiet environment

            * Monitor blood pressure

            * Nutritional support as needed.

4.  **Post-Stabilization Management:**

    * **Monitoring:**

        * Continuous ECG monitoring.

        * Frequent monitoring of vital signs (HR, RR, temperature, blood pressure).

        * Neurologic status (mentation, tremors, seizures).

        * Urine output.

    * **Fluid Therapy:**

        * Continue IV fluids as needed.

    * **Anti-arrhythmic Therapy:**

        * Adjust or discontinue anti-arrhythmic medications based on ECG findings.

    * **Seizure Management:**

        * Continue or adjust anti-seizure medications as needed.

        * Monitor for recurrence of seizures.

    * **Tremor Control:**

        * Continue or adjust medications.

    * **Temperature Management:**

        * Continue cooling measures if hyperthermia persists.

        * Monitor for hypothermia if aggressive cooling is used.

    * **Long-Term Management:**

        * Monitor liver values.

        * Provide supportive care as needed.

**Prognosis:**

The prognosis for chocolate toxicity depends on several factors:

* **Amount and type of chocolate ingested:** Dark chocolate and baking chocolate are more toxic than milk chocolate.

* **Time to treatment:** Prompt decontamination and treatment improve the prognosis.

* **Severity of clinical signs:** Patients with severe neurological or cardiovascular signs have a poorer prognosis.

* **Underlying health conditions:** Pre-existing conditions can increase the risk of complications.

With prompt and appropriate treatment, most dogs recover from chocolate toxicity.
