## Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) - Canine

**Definition:** A rapid heart rhythm originating in the ventricles, characterized by wide QRS complexes on ECG.

**Triage (1-2 minutes):**

* **Cardiovascular:**
    * Heart rate: Rapid (>180 bpm, often much higher).
    * Pulse quality: Weak or absent.
    * Blood pressure: Hypotension (may be severe).
    * Mucous membrane color: Pale, cyanotic.
    * Capillary refill time (CRT): Prolonged.
* **Respiratory:**
    * Tachypnea (rapid breathing).
    * Increased respiratory effort (if associated with pulmonary edema or poor perfusion).
* **Mentation:**
    * Alert, depressed, or obtunded.
    * Syncope (fainting) may occur.

**Immediate Actions (0-5 minutes):**

* **Oxygen:** Administer high-flow oxygen via mask, nasal cannula, or endotracheal tube.
* **IV Access:** Establish two large-bore intravenous catheters.
* **ECG:** Continuous ECG monitoring is critical.
* **Lidocaine:**
    * Bolus: 2-4 mg/kg IV slowly over 2-5 minutes.
    * If VT persists: Repeat bolus at 1-2 mg/kg IV every 5-10 minutes to a total of 6-8 mg/kg.
    * Constant Rate Infusion (CRI): 25-75 mcg/kg/min IV.
* **Fluid Therapy:**
    * If hypotensive: Administer crystalloid bolus (10-20 ml/kg) cautiously.
    * Avoid overhydration, especially if cardiac function is compromised.
* **Address Underlying Cause:** If known (e.g., electrolyte imbalance, GDV), begin treatment.

**Stabilization (5-15 minutes):**

* **Diagnostics:**
    * Blood pressure measurement (Doppler or oscillometric).
    * Blood work:
        * Complete blood count (CBC).
        * Serum biochemistry profile (electrolytes, renal values, liver enzymes).
        * Lactate.
    * Thoracic radiographs: Evaluate for pulmonary edema, cardiomegaly.
* **Further Treatment:**
    * Repeat lidocaine bolus if VT recurs.
    * If lidocaine is ineffective:
        * Amiodarone: 5 mg/kg IV over 20-60 minutes, followed by a CRI (15-40 mcg/kg/min).
        * Procainamide: 6-8 mg/kg IV slowly over 5 minutes, may repeat to a total of 12-16 mg/kg.
    * Correct electrolyte abnormalities:
        * Hypokalemia: Supplement potassium intravenously.
        * Hypomagnesemia: Supplement magnesium intravenously.
    * Treat underlying disease:
        * GDV: Proceed to surgery.
        * Dilated cardiomyopathy: Pimobendan, diuretics.
        * Myocarditis: Supportive care, anti-inflammatories?
* **Consider Vagal Maneuvers:**
    * Ocular pressure (careful, short duration).
* **Consider Electrical Cardioversion:**
    * If hemodynamically unstable VT is refractory to medical management.
    * Synchronized cardioversion: 0.5-2 J/kg.

**Post-Stabilization Management:**

* **Continuous Monitoring:**
    * ECG.
    * Blood pressure.
    * Respiratory rate and effort.
    * Mentation.
    * Urine output.
* **Long-Term Anti-arrhythmic Therapy:**
    * Oral anti-arrhythmics (e.g., sotalol, mexiletine, amiodarone) may be needed.
* **Treat Underlying Disease:** Critical for long-term management.
* **Repeat Diagnostics:**
    * Echocardiography: To assess cardiac function and structure.
    * Holter monitoring: To evaluate long-term rhythm control.

**Prognosis:**

* Depends on the underlying cause and response to treatment.
* VT can be life-threatening, especially if associated with:
    * Severe hemodynamic compromise.
    * Refractory arrhythmias.
    * Significant underlying heart disease.
