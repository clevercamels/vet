# Emergency Protocol: Feline Urethral Obstruction

This protocol outlines the emergency management of feline patients presenting with urethral obstruction. This is a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate intervention. The steps should be performed promptly and concurrently as the patient's condition dictates.

## 1. Initial Assessment and Stabilization

* Recognize clinical signs: Straining to urinate (stranguria), vocalization, frequent trips to the litter box, licking at the后端, firm and distended abdomen (indicating a full bladder). Some cats may present as lethargic, weak, or collapsed.
* Perform a rapid, focused physical examination: Assess hydration status, heart rate and rhythm, pulse quality, mucous membrane color, capillary refill time, and palpate the abdomen very gently for bladder size and turgor.
* *Warning: Gentle palpation is crucial to avoid bladder rupture.*
* Establish intravenous (IV) access immediately. A large bore catheter is preferred for rapid fluid administration.
* Administer supplemental oxygen, especially to dyspneic or compromised cats.

## 2. Emergency Diagnostics

* Obtain blood samples for a minimum database: Packed cell volume (PCV), total solids (TS), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, electrolytes (especially potassium), and glucose.
* Perform an electrocardiogram (ECG) to assess for arrhythmias, particularly those associated with hyperkalemia (e.g., bradycardia, tall tented T waves, widened QRS complexes).
* Obtain a urine sample if possible (see Section 3.1).
* Consider blood gas analysis to assess acid-base status.

## 3. Emergency Treatment - Prioritize Life-Threatening Abnormalities and Relieve Obstruction

* **Fluid Therapy**
    * Administer IV crystalloid fluids aggressively to address dehydration, improve renal perfusion, and help correct electrolyte and acid-base imbalances.
    * Isotonic crystalloids (e.g., LRS, 0.9% NaCl, Plasma-Lyte) are appropriate. 0.9% NaCl may be preferred initially if severe hyperkalemia is present.
    * **Initial Shock Bolus (if indicated by poor perfusion/hypotension):** 10-20 mL/kg IV over 15-20 minutes.
    * **Maintenance/Rehydration Rate:** Adjust rate based on hydration status, ongoing losses, and urine output after unblocking. Often higher than standard maintenance initially (e.g., 60-100 mL/kg/day or higher).

* **Address Severe Hyperkalemia (if present and causing ECG abnormalities or severe bradycardia)**
    * **Calcium Gluconate (10%)**: 0.5-1 mL/kg IV slowly over 5-10 minutes while monitoring ECG. This helps stabilize the myocardium but does not lower potassium levels.
    * **Glucose**: 0.5-1 g/kg IV (diluted). Administer as a bolus or CRI. This stimulates endogenous insulin release, driving potassium intracellularly.
    * **Insulin (Regular)**: 0.1-0.25 U/kg IV. Follow with glucose to prevent hypoglycemia.
    * **Sodium Bicarbonate**: 1-2 mEq/kg IV slowly over 15-20 minutes. Use cautiously and only if severe metabolic acidosis is present (pH < 7.1) and other measures are insufficient, as it can worsen hypocalcemia.

* **Analgesia and Sedation**
    * Provide effective analgesia as urethral obstruction is painful.
    * Administer appropriate sedation to facilitate examination and the unblocking procedure.
    * *Examples:* Opioids (e.g., buprenorphine, hydromorphone) combined with sedatives (e.g., midazolam, diazepam) or dissociative anesthetics (e.g., ketamine) in carefully selected patients. Alpha-2 agonists can be used in stable patients but monitor for bradycardia and hypotension.

* **Relieve Urethral Obstruction**
    * **Cystocentesis (Decompressive):** May be performed with a small gauge needle (22-25 gauge butterfly or needle) to immediately relieve bladder distension and discomfort, reduce pressure on the kidneys, and make urethral catheterization easier.
        * *Technique: Insert needle into the ventral aspect of the bladder, directing caudally.*
        * *Collect a urine sample for urinalysis and culture.*
        * *Perform with caution to minimize risk of bladder rupture or urine leakage.*
    * **Urethral Catheterization:** This is the definitive method for relieving the obstruction.
        * Use aseptic technique.
        * Extrude the penis and gently attempt to pass a well-lubricated urinary catheter (e.g., open-ended tomcat catheter, slippery sam catheter).
        * Gentle pulsatile flushing with sterile saline or LRS through the catheter while advancing can help dislodge the obstruction.
        * If a rigid tomcat catheter is used to unblock, it should be replaced with a softer indwelling catheter (e.g., red rubber, silicone) once patency is established.
        * Secure the indwelling catheter in place with sutures (e.g., finger trap suture).
        * Attach a closed sterile collection system.

## 4. Post-Obstruction Management

* **Maintain Indwelling Urinary Catheter:** Typically for 24-72 hours, or until urine is clear and dilute and systemic abnormalities have resolved.
* **Monitor for Post-Obstructive Diuresis:** Increased urine production is common after relieving obstruction due to renal tubule dysfunction.
    * Monitor urine output closely (measure collected urine).
    * Adjust IV fluid rates to match urine output and maintain hydration.
    * Monitor electrolytes frequently, as hypokalemia can develop.
* **Continue Fluid Therapy:** Maintain IV fluids until the cat is well-hydrated, azotemia has resolved or significantly improved, and post-obstructive diuresis has subsided.
* **Pain Management:** Continue appropriate analgesia.
* **Urethral Relaxants:** Medications like prazosin or phenoxybenzamine (alpha-1 blockers) may be used to help relax the urethral sphincter and reduce the risk of re-obstruction. Acepromazine can also have some urethral relaxing effects.
* **Address Underlying Cause:** Investigate the cause of the obstruction (e.g., crystals, stones, plug, inflammation) through urinalysis, urine culture, and imaging (radiographs, ultrasound).
* **Monitoring:**
    * Continue monitoring vital signs, hydration, and attitude.
    * Monitor urine output.
    * Repeat bloodwork (electrolytes, renal values) as needed to assess response to fluid therapy and resolution of abnormalities.
    * Monitor ECG if initial abnormalities were present.

## 5. Catheter Removal and Monitoring for Spontaneous Urination

* Once the cat is stable, azotemia and electrolyte abnormalities have resolved, and post-obstructive diuresis is controlled, the indwelling catheter can be removed.
* Monitor closely for spontaneous urination after catheter removal.
* Ensure the cat is comfortable and has access to a clean litter box.
* Palpate the bladder periodically to ensure it is not becoming distended again.
* If the cat does not urinate within a reasonable timeframe (typically 12-24 hours) or becomes obstructed again, the catheter may need to be replaced.

## 6. Discharge Planning and Follow-up

* Address the underlying cause with appropriate dietary changes, medications, or other management strategies (e.g., environmental enrichment for stress reduction).
* Discuss the risk of re-obstruction with the owner.
* Schedule follow-up appointments for recheck examinations and diagnostics.
