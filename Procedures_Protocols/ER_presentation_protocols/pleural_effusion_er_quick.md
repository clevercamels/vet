## Pleural Effusion - ER quick

**Presenting Complaint:** Known or suspected pleural effusion.

**Definition:** Pleural effusion is the abnormal accumulation of fluid within the pleural space, the space between the lungs and the chest wall. This accumulation can compromise respiratory function.

**Triage:**

1.  **Initial Assessment (within 1-2 minutes):**

    * **Observation:**

        * Dyspnea (difficulty breathing)
        * Tachypnea (rapid breathing)
        * Increased respiratory effort (e.g., abdominal breathing, paradoxical chest wall movement)
        * Cough (may be present)
        * Lethargy or weakness
        * Cyanosis (bluish discoloration of mucous membranes)
        * Orthopnea (difficulty breathing when lying down)
    * **Cardiovascular:**

        * Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
        * Muffled heart sounds
        * Weak pulses
    * **Respiratory:**

        * Increased respiratory rate and effort
        * Shallow, rapid breathing
        * Crackles or decreased lung sounds on auscultation
    * **Mentation:**

        * Anxious or restless
        * Depressed or obtunded (in severe cases)

2.  **Immediate Actions (0-5 minutes):**

    * **Oxygen Supplementation:**

        * Administer oxygen via mask, nasal cannula, or flow-by. High-flow oxygen is often necessary.
    * **Positioning:**

        * Place the cat in a sternal recumbent position (on its chest) to improve lung expansion. Avoid placing the cat on its back.
    * **Establish IV Access:**

        * Place an intravenous catheter in the cephalic or saphenous vein.

    * ** Cardiovascular monitoring**

        * Place the patient on continuous ECG to monitor for arrhythmias.
    * **Thoracocentesis (if indicated):**

        * If the patient is in severe respiratory distress, immediate thoracocentesis (needle drainage of the pleural space) may be necessary.
        * Aseptically prepare a wide area of the chest wall, usually between the 7th and 9th intercostal spaces.
        * Use a large-bore catheter (18-22 gauge) with a three-way stopcock and extension set.
        * Advance the needle cranially, just dorsal to the rib, to avoid the intercostal vessels.
        * Remove fluid slowly and monitor the patient's respiratory effort.
        * Do not remove more fluid than necessary to stabilize the patient.
        * Save a sample of the fluid for analysis (see Diagnostics).

3.  **Stabilization (15-60 minutes):**

    * **Further Assessment:**

        * **Respiratory:** Reassess respiratory rate and effort after thoracocentesis.
        * **Cardiovascular:** Reassess heart rate, pulse quality, and blood pressure.
        * **Mentation:** Monitor level of consciousness.
    * **Diagnostics:**

        * **Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS):**
            * If available, use to quickly assess for pleural effusion and guide thoracocentesis.
        * **Radiography:**
            * Once the patient is stable, obtain thoracic radiographs (lateral and dorsoventral views) to confirm pleural effusion and identify underlying causes (e.g., heart disease, pneumonia, neoplasia).
        * **Blood Work:**
            * Complete blood count (CBC)
            * Serum biochemistry profile (electrolytes, renal values, liver enzymes, total protein)
            * Blood gas analysis (venous or arterial) if significant respiratory compromise
            * Coagulation profile (PT/PTT) if indicated
        * **Fluid Analysis:**
            * Submit a sample of the pleural fluid for:
                * Total protein and cell count
                * Cytology (microscopic examination of cells)
                * Culture and sensitivity (if infection is suspected)
                * Fluid type (transudate, modified transudate, exudate, chylous, hemorrhagic)
        * **Other diagnostics:**
             * FeLV/FIV testing
             * Heartworm testing
             * Echocardiography (if heart disease is suspected)
             * Abdominal ultrasound (to evaluate for concurrent disease)

    * **Treatment:**

        * **Oxygen Therapy:** Continue oxygen supplementation as needed.
        * **Fluid Therapy:**
            * Administer intravenous crystalloid fluids (e.g., lactated Ringer's solution, 0.9% saline) to maintain hydration and support cardiovascular function.  Adjust rate based on patient needs.
        * **Diuretics:**
            * If heart failure is the underlying cause:
                * Furosemide (1-2 mg/kg IV or IM)
            * *Use diuretics cautiously and only if the patient is adequately hydrated.*
        * **Antibiotics:**
            * If bacterial infection (pyothorax) is suspected:
                * Broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics (e.g., ampicillin-sulbactam, cefoxitin)
        * **Thoracocentesis:**
            * Repeat thoracocentesis as needed to relieve respiratory distress.
            * Consider placement of a chest tube for continuous drainage if large volumes of fluid accumulate rapidly.
        * **Pain Management:**
             * Opioids (e.g., buprenorphine)
        * **Specific Treatments:**
            * **Chylothorax:** Low-fat diet, Rutin, surgical management (thoracic duct ligation)
            * **Pyothorax:** Chest tube drainage, antibiotics, surgical exploration
            * **Heart Failure:** Diuretics, pimobendan
            * **Neoplasia:** Chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery

4.  **Post-Stabilization Management:**

    * **Monitoring:**

        * Monitor respiratory rate and effort closely.
        * Monitor cardiovascular parameters (HR, blood pressure).
        * Monitor oxygen saturation (SpO2) if available.
        * Monitor urine output.
        * Monitor for recurrence of pleural effusion (repeat radiographs or ultrasound).
    * **Fluid Therapy:**

        * Continue IV fluids as needed.
    * **Oxygen Therapy:**

        * Continue oxygen supplementation as needed.
    * **Chest Tube Management (if present):**

        * Monitor drainage volume and character.
        * Maintain a closed drainage system.
        * Flush the chest tube as needed to prevent blockage.
    * **Medications:**

        * Administer diuretics, antibiotics, or other medications as prescribed.
    * **Nutritional Support:**

        * Provide nutritional support as needed.  May require assisted feeding.
    * **Activity:**

        * Restrict activity to cage rest.
    * **Complications:**
        * Pneumothorax (air in the pleural space)
        * Infection (if chest tube is present)
        * Re-expansion pulmonary edema
        * Electrolyte imbalances

5. **Prognosis**
    * The prognosis for feline pleural effusion varies widely depending on the underlying cause:
        * **Congestive heart failure:** guarded to poor
        * **Pyothorax:** fair to good with aggressive treatment
        * **Chylothorax:** variable, dependent on response to medical or surgical management
        * **Neoplasia: ** poor
        * **FIP:** poor

    * Factors affecting prognosis:
        * Severity of respiratory distress
        * Underlying disease
        * Response to treatment
        * Presence of complications
