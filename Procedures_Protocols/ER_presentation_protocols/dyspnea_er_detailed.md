## Veterinary Emergency Protocol: Dyspnea

**Presenting Complaint:** Dyspnea (Labored Breathing)

**Definition:** Dyspnea is difficult or labored breathing.  It is characterized by an increased *effort* to breathe.  This is distinct from tachypnea, which is an increased *rate* of breathing, though both can occur together.  Dyspnea is a subjective clinical sign; the patient perceives that they cannot breathe effectively.

**Triage:**

1.  **Initial Assessment (within 1-2 minutes):**
    * **Respiratory Effort:**
        * Assess the degree of respiratory effort: mild, moderate, severe.
        * Observe breathing pattern:
            * Inspiratory dyspnea: Difficulty getting air *in* (e.g., upper airway obstruction).
            * Expiratory dyspnea: Difficulty getting air *out* (e.g., asthma).
            * Mixed inspiratory/expiratory dyspnea:  Both phases of respiration are difficult (e.g., pulmonary edema).
        * Identify specific signs:
            * Increased abdominal effort ("belly breathing")
            * Extended neck
            * Abducted elbows
            * Open-mouth breathing (especially in cats)
            * Paradoxical chest wall movement (chest moves in while abdomen moves out)
            * Nasal flaring
    * **Respiratory Rate:** Note the respiratory rate (may be increased or decreased).
    * **Mentation:** Is the patient alert, obtunded, or comatose?  Changes in mentation can indicate severe hypoxemia or hypercapnia.
    * **Cardiovascular:**
        * Check heart rate and pulse quality.  Tachycardia is common, but bradycardia can indicate decompensation.
        * Assess mucous membrane color (pink, pale, cyanotic). Cyanosis is a *late* sign of severe hypoxemia.
        * Check capillary refill time (CRT).
    * **Oxygenation:**
        * If possible, obtain a pulse oximetry reading (SpO2).  Be aware that pulse oximetry can be unreliable in patients with poor perfusion or heavily pigmented mucous membranes.

2.  **Immediate Actions (0-5 minutes):**
    * **Oxygen Supplementation:**
        * Administer oxygen *immediately*.  The method of oxygen delivery will depend on the severity of dyspnea and the patient's tolerance:
            * Flow-by oxygen:  For mild to moderate dyspnea.
            * Oxygen mask:  For moderate dyspnea.
            * Oxygen cage:  For moderate to severe dyspnea, especially in cats.
            * Nasal cannula:  For moderate dyspnea, if tolerated.
            * **Intubation and positive pressure ventilation:** For *severe* dyspnea, cyanosis, impending respiratory arrest, or poor response to other oxygen delivery methods.  This is often necessary for patients with upper airway obstruction, severe pulmonary parenchymal disease, or neuromuscular disease.
    * **Minimize Stress:**
        * *Handle the patient with extreme care and as little restraint as possible.* Stress can significantly worsen dyspnea and lead to decompensation.
        * Allow the patient to assume a comfortable position.
        * Consider *mild* sedation, *but only if absolutely necessary* to facilitate oxygen delivery or prevent self-trauma, and *only* if it will not compromise respiratory drive.  Choose a reversible agent if possible. Examples:
            * Butorphanol (0.1-0.2 mg/kg IV, IM).
            * Dexmedetomidine (1-3 mcg/kg IV, IM) *with extreme caution and careful monitoring*.  Reversible with atipamezole.
    * **Establish IV Access:**
        * Place an intravenous catheter for administration of fluids and medications.
    * **Monitoring:**
        * Continuous ECG.
        * Frequent monitoring of respiratory rate, respiratory effort, heart rate, pulse quality, mucous membrane color, CRT, and oxygen saturation.

**Stabilization (5-15 minutes):**

1.  **Further Assessment:**
    * **Brief History:**
        * Obtain a focused history, if possible without further stressing the patient:
            * Duration and progression of dyspnea (acute vs. chronic)
            * Character of dyspnea (inspiratory, expiratory, mixed)
            * Other signs (cough, wheezing, exercise intolerance, lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea)
            * Pre-existing conditions (heart disease, asthma, laryngeal paralysis)
            * Recent trauma
            * Exposure to toxins (e.g., smoke inhalation)
    * **Focused Physical Exam:**
        * *Auscultate the lungs and heart carefully.* Note any abnormal sounds (crackles, wheezes, stridor, decreased or absent sounds).
        * *Examine the upper airways* for evidence of obstruction (foreign body, swelling).
        * Palpate the chest wall.
        * Assess for jugular venous distension (indicating potential cardiac disease or pleural effusion).

2.  **Diagnostics:**
    * **Stat Diagnostics:**
        * **Blood Gas Analysis (Arterial or Venous):** To assess oxygenation (PaO2, SaO2), ventilation (PaCO2), and acid-base status.  Arterial is preferred, but venous can provide useful information.
        * **Point-of-Care (POC) Blood Work:** PCV/TP, blood glucose, electrolytes.
        * **Thoracic Radiographs:** *Obtain only after the patient is stabilized and can tolerate the procedure.* Take radiographs quickly and efficiently.  Consider positioning the patient in sternal recumbency if possible.  Look for:
            * Pulmonary edema (cardiogenic vs. non-cardiogenic)
            * Pneumonia (aspiration, bacterial, viral)
            * Pleural effusion
            * Pneumothorax
            * Masses
            * Diaphragmatic hernia
        * **FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma, Triage, and Tracking) exam:** A rapid bedside ultrasound to assess for:
            * Pleural effusion
            * Pneumothorax
            * Pericardial effusion
            * Pulmonary edema
    * **Additional Diagnostics (as indicated):**
        * Complete blood count (CBC)
        * Serum biochemistry profile
        * Coagulation profile
        * Urinalysis
        * Echocardiogram:  If cardiac disease is suspected.
        * Advanced imaging (CT scan, MRI):  May be necessary for complex cases (e.g., suspected pulmonary thromboembolism, upper airway obstruction).
        * Bronchoscopy/Tracheoscopy:  For evaluation of the airways and to obtain samples (e.g., transtracheal wash, bronchoalveolar lavage).
        * Cytology/culture of pleural fluid:  If pleural effusion is present.

**Differential Diagnoses:**

Dyspnea is a critical sign with a wide range of underlying causes.  It is essential to categorize the possibilities to guide diagnosis and treatment:

* **Upper Airway Disease:**
    * Foreign body
    * Laryngeal paralysis/paresis
    * Brachycephalic airway syndrome
    * Laryngeal edema (e.g., allergic reaction, trauma)
    * Tracheal collapse
    * Neoplasia
    * Infectious diseases (e.g., fungal infection)
* **Lower Airway Disease:**
    * Asthma (cats) / Chronic bronchitis (dogs)
    * Pneumonia (bacterial, viral, aspiration, fungal)
    * Pulmonary edema (cardiogenic, non-cardiogenic)
    * Pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE)
    * Neoplasia
    * Infectious diseases
* **Pleural Space Disease:**
    * Pleural effusion (transudate, exudate, blood, chyle)
    * Pneumothorax
    * Diaphragmatic hernia
    * Pyothorax
    * Neoplasia
* **Cardiac Disease:**
    * Congestive heart failure (CHF)
    * Cardiomyopathy
    * Pericardial effusion
    * Arrhythmias
* **Neuromuscular Disease:**
    * Myasthenia gravis
    * Polyneuropathy/myopathy
    * Diaphragmatic paralysis
* **Other:**
    * Anemia
    * Metabolic acidosis
    * Sepsis
    * Pain
    * Anxiety/Stress
    * Heatstroke

**Treatment:**

Treatment must be tailored to the underlying cause.  However, the following are key components in the management of *any* dyspneic patient:

* **Oxygen Therapy:** Continue and adjust oxygen supplementation based on the patient's response.  Monitor oxygen saturation (SpO2) and blood gas analysis.
* **Airway Management:**
    * **Intubation and positive pressure ventilation:** May be required for severe dyspnea, respiratory failure, or impending arrest.
    * **Tracheostomy:** May be necessary for upper airway obstruction that cannot be relieved by other means.
* **Fluid Therapy:** Administer intravenous fluids with caution.  Overhydration can worsen pulmonary edema.  Use crystalloids initially, and consider colloids if indicated.
* **Medications:** Use judiciously, and target the specific underlying condition:
    * **Diuretics (e.g., Furosemide):** For cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
    * **Bronchodilators (e.g., Albuterol, Theophylline):** For asthma/bronchitis.
    * **Antibiotics:** For bacterial pneumonia.  Choose broad-spectrum initially, then narrow based on culture and sensitivity.
    * **Corticosteroids (e.g., Dexamethasone):** May be indicated for certain conditions (e.g., asthma, allergic reactions), but avoid in infectious pneumonia unless specifically indicated and with concurrent antibiotics.
    * **Analgesics:** Provide pain relief, as pain can exacerbate dyspnea.  Use opioids with caution, as they can cause respiratory depression.  Consider partial mu-agonists (e.g., buprenorphine) or pure mu-agonists (e.g., morphine, hydromorphone) with careful monitoring.
    * **Sedatives (e.g., Butorphanol, Dexmedetomidine):** Use with extreme caution, and only if necessary to relieve severe anxiety that is worsening the dyspnea.  Monitor respiratory effort and oxygenation closely.  Avoid sedatives in patients with suspected upper airway obstruction unless intubation is imminent or already performed.
* **Thoracocentesis/Chest Tube Placement:** For pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Remove fluid or air as completely as possible.
* **Pericardiocentesis:** For pericardial effusion causing tamponade.
* **Surgery:** May be necessary for certain conditions (e.g., foreign body removal, diaphragmatic hernia repair, laryngeal tie-back for laryngeal paralysis).
* **Positive Pressure Ventilation (PPV):** Patients with severe dyspnea, hypoventilation, or respiratory failure may require mechanical ventilation.

**Monitoring and Reassessment:**

* *Continuous monitoring* of:
    * Respiratory rate and effort
    * Heart rate and pulse quality
    * Mucous membrane color and CRT
    * Oxygen saturation (SpO2)
    * ECG
* Frequent reassessment of the patient's response to treatment.
* Repeat blood gas analysis and other diagnostics as needed.
* Be prepared to *escalate care* (e.g., intubation, mechanical ventilation, transfer to a specialty hospital) if the patient's condition deteriorates.

**Prognosis:**

The prognosis for a dyspneic patient is highly variable and depends on the underlying cause, the severity of respiratory compromise, and the patient's response to treatment.  Dyspnea is always a serious sign, and prompt, aggressive intervention is crucial.
