## Veterinary Emergency Protocol: Canine Marijuana Ingestion Toxicity

**Presenting Complaint:** Known or suspected ingestion of marijuana.

**Definition:** Marijuana toxicity in dogs is caused by the tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) present in the cannabis plant. THC is the primary psychoactive component and is toxic to dogs, causing a range of clinical signs.

**Triage:**

1.  **Initial Assessment (within 1-2 minutes):**

    * **History:**

        * Form of marijuana ingested (e.g., flower, edibles, oil).
        * Amount of marijuana ingested (if known).
        * Time of ingestion.
        * Dog's weight.
        * Pre-existing conditions.
    * **Observation:**

        * Lethargy, depression
        * Ataxia (uncoordinated movement)
        * Dilated pupils
        * Nystagmus (involuntary eye movement)
        * Vomiting
        * Urinary incontinence
        * Bradycardia (slow heart rate) or tachycardia (fast heart rate)
        * Hypothermia (low body temperature) or hyperthermia (high body temperature)
        * Hyperesthesia (increased sensitivity to stimuli)
        * Seizures (rare)
        * Coma (in severe cases)
    * **Cardiovascular:**
        * Bradycardia or tachycardia
    * **Respiratory:**
        * Depressed respiration
    * **Neurologic:**
        * Ataxia
        * Depression
        * Dilated pupils
        * Nystagmus
        * Hyperesthesia
        * Seizures (rare)
        * Coma (in severe cases)

2.  **Immediate Actions (0-5 minutes):**

    * **Decontamination (if ingestion within 2 hours):**
        * **Induce Emesis:**
            * If the dog is asymptomatic and ingestion is recent (within 2 hours), induce vomiting.
            * Contraindications to emesis:
                * Symptomatic patients (lethargy, ataxia, depression) - increased risk of aspiration
                * Pre-existing conditions (e.g., megaesophagus, laryngeal paralysis)
                * Ingestion of caustic substances
            * Agents:
                * 3% Hydrogen Peroxide: 1-2 ml/kg orally, maximum 45 ml. May repeat once after 10-15 minutes if no emesis.
                * Apomorphine (IV or conjunctival): 0.03-0.04 mg/kg IV.
        * **Activated Charcoal:**
            * Administer activated charcoal (1-5 g/kg orally) after emesis or if emesis is contraindicated.
            * May repeat activated charcoal administration every 4-6 hours.
    * **Establish IV Access:**
        * Place an intravenous catheter in the cephalic or saphenous vein.
    * **Oxygen Supplementation:**
        * Administer oxygen via mask, nasal cannula, or flow-by if the patient is symptomatic, especially if there are respiratory or neurological signs.
    * **ECG:**
        * Place the patient on continuous ECG to monitor for arrhythmias, although they are less common than with other toxins.

3.  **Stabilization (15-60 minutes):**

    * **Further Assessment:**
        * **Cardiovascular:** Reassess HR, pulse quality.
        * **Respiratory:** Evaluate respiratory rate and effort.
        * **Neurologic:** Monitor mentation, ataxia, and other neurological signs.
        * **Temperature:** Assess rectal temperature.
    * **Diagnostics:**
        * **Blood Work:**
            * Serum biochemistry profile (electrolytes, renal values, liver enzymes).
            * Complete blood count (CBC).
        * **Urinalysis:** To rule out other causes of neurological signs.
    * **Treatment:**
        * **Intravenous Fluids:**
            * Administer crystalloid fluids (e.g., lactated Ringer's solution, 0.9% saline) to maintain hydration and support cardiovascular function.
            * Adjust fluid rate based on patient needs.
        * **Temperature Management:**
            * If hypothermic: Provide active warming (e.g., warm air blanket, warm water bottles).
            * If hyperthermic: Provide cooling measures (e.g., fans, cool water baths, ice packs).
        * **Respiratory Support:**
            * If respiratory depression is present, provide assisted ventilation (e.g., bag-valve-mask, mechanical ventilation).
        * **Neurologic Support:**
            * Keep the patient in a quiet, dark environment to minimize stimulation.
            * Sedatives:
                * If agitation or severe ataxia:
                    * Diazepam: 0.5-1 mg/kg IV or orally
                    * Acepromazine: 0.01-0.02 mg/kg IV, IM, or orally (use with caution, may prolong sedation)
        * **Anti-emetics:**
            * If vomiting is present:
                * Maropitant: 1 mg/kg IV or SQ
                * Metoclopramide: 0.2-0.5 mg/kg IV or orally
        * **Urinary Catheterization:**
             * If urinary incontinence is severe or prolonged.

4.  **Post-Stabilization Management:**

    * **Monitoring:**
        * Continuous ECG monitoring.
        * Frequent monitoring of vital signs (HR, RR, temperature, blood pressure).
        * Neurologic status (mentation, ataxia).
        * Urine output.
    * **Fluid Therapy:**
        * Continue IV fluids as needed.
    * **Temperature Management:**
        * Continue warming or cooling measures as needed.
    * **Respiratory Support:**
        * Continue assisted ventilation if needed.
    * **Neurologic Monitoring:**
        * Monitor for improvement in neurological signs.
        * Continue sedation as needed.
    * **Supportive Care:**
        * Provide a quiet and comfortable environment.
        * Monitor for secondary complications (e.g., aspiration pneumonia).
        * Nutritional support as needed.

**Prognosis:**

The prognosis for marijuana toxicity in dogs is generally good. Most dogs recover with supportive care within 24-72 hours. However, the prognosis can be influenced by:

* **Amount ingested:** Larger amounts can lead to more severe signs and a longer recovery.
* **Form of marijuana:** Edibles may have a delayed onset of action and prolonged effects.
* **Patient size and age:** Smaller and younger dogs may be more severely affected.
* **Pre-existing conditions:** Underlying health issues can increase the risk of complicatio
