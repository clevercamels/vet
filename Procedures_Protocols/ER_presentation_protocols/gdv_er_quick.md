## Veterinary Emergency Protocol: Canine Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus (GDV)

**Presenting Complaint:** Signs of gastric dilatation-volvulus, commonly referred to as GDV or "bloat."

**Definition:** Gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV) is a life-threatening condition in dogs involving:

* **Dilatation:** Abnormal distension of the stomach with gas, fluid, and/or food.
* **Volvulus:** Rotation of the stomach on its mesenteric axis, leading to vascular compromise, tissue necrosis, and systemic shock.

**Triage:**

1.  **Initial Assessment (within 1-2 minutes):**

    * **Observation:**
        * Restlessness and anxiety
        * Non-productive retching or attempts to vomit
        * Abdominal distension (often tympanic)
        * Pacing
        * Excessive salivation
        * Weakness or collapse
    * **Cardiovascular:**
        * Tachycardia (rapid heart rate) - often >120-140 bpm
        * Weak peripheral pulses
        * Prolonged capillary refill time (CRT) - >2 seconds
        * Pale mucous membranes
        * Possible arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular premature contractions - VPCs)
    * **Respiratory:**
        * Rapid, shallow breathing (tachypnea)
        * Increased respiratory effort
    * **Mentation:**
        * Alert, anxious, or depressed
        * In severe cases: obtunded or comatose

2.  **Immediate Actions (0-5 minutes):**

    * **Oxygen Supplementation:**
        * Administer oxygen via mask, nasal cannula, or flow-by.
    * **Establish IV Access:**
        * Place *two* large-bore intravenous catheters (14-18 gauge) in the cephalic or saphenous veins.
    * **Fluid Resuscitation:**
        * Initiate aggressive crystalloid fluid therapy (e.g., lactated Ringer's solution, 0.9% saline).
        * Administer initial bolus of 20-30 ml/kg IV over 15-30 minutes.
        * Reassess frequently and adjust fluid rate based on response.
    * **Gastric Decompression:**
        * **Orogastric Intubation:**
            * Pass a large-bore orogastric tube (1/2 to 3/4 inch diameter) into the stomach.
            * Measure the tube from the tip of the nose to the last rib.
            * Lubricate the tube well.
            * Pass the tube gently, directing it dorsally and medially.
            * If resistance is met, rotate the tube gently.
            * If resistance persists, reposition the head and neck and try again.
            * *Do not* force the tube.
            * Once the tube is in the stomach, gas and fluid will be released.
            * Lavage the stomach with warm water (5-10 ml/kg aliquots) to remove debris.
        * **Trocarization (if orogastric intubation is unsuccessful):**
            * If an orogastric tube cannot be passed, trocarization may be necessary to relieve pressure.
            * Aseptically prepare a wide area of the right lateral abdominal wall.
            * Use a large-bore needle or trocar (14-16 gauge) to penetrate the abdominal wall into the stomach.
            * Direct the trocar caudally. A hissing sound indicates successful decompression.
    * **Cardiac Monitoring:**
        * Place the patient on continuous ECG to monitor for arrhythmias.
    * **Pain Management:**
        * Administer an opioid analgesic (e.g., methadone 0.2-0.4 mg/kg IV, hydromorphone 0.1-0.2 mg/kg IV).
        * Avoid NSAIDs pre-operatively.

3.  **Stabilization (15-60 minutes):**

    * **Further Assessment:**
        * **Abdominal Palpation:** Assess the degree of distension and pain.
        * **Cardiovascular:** Reassess HR, pulse quality, CRT, and mucous membrane color.
        * **Respiratory:** Evaluate respiratory rate and effort.
        * **Mentation:** Monitor level of consciousness.
    * **Diagnostics:**
        * **Blood Work:**
            * Packed cell volume (PCV) / Total protein (TP): To assess hydration status.
            * Blood glucose: May be elevated due to stress.
            * Lactate: A critical prognostic indicator. Elevated lactate (>6-9 mmol/L) is associated with gastric necrosis and a higher mortality rate.
            * Electrolytes: Assess for imbalances (e.g., hypokalemia).
            * Blood gas analysis (venous or arterial): To evaluate acid-base status.
        * **Radiography:**
            * Right lateral abdominal radiograph: Classic findings include a distended, gas-filled stomach and a "double bubble" or "Popeye arm" appearance indicating the pylorus displaced dorsally and to the left.
        * **ECG:** Evaluate for arrhythmias, especially ventricular premature contractions (VPCs), which are common and can precede more serious arrhythmias.
    * **Additional Treatment:**
        * **Continue Fluid Therapy:** Adjust rate based on patient response. May need to switch to a balanced electrolyte solution.
        * **Correct Electrolyte Imbalances:** Supplement potassium if hypokalemic.
        * **Anti-arrhythmic Therapy:**
            * If hemodynamically significant ventricular arrhythmias (e.g., tachycardia, frequent VPCs) are present, administer lidocaine (2-4 mg/kg IV bolus, followed by a 25-75 mcg/kg/min CRI).
        * **Antibiotics:**
            * Administer broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics (e.g., cefazolin 22 mg/kg IV, ampicillin-sulbactam 30 mg/kg IV). GDV can lead to bacterial translocation and sepsis.
        * **Gastroprotectants:**
            * Administer a proton pump inhibitor (e.g., omeprazole 1 mg/kg IV) to reduce gastric acid production.
        * **Plasma Transfusion:**
            * Consider if the patient is coagulopathic or has evidence of severe shock.

4.  **Surgery:**

    * **Indications:** GDV is a surgical emergency. Surgery should be performed as soon as the patient is hemodynamically stable.
    * **Goals:**
        * Decompress the stomach.
        * Reposition the stomach to its normal anatomic position.
        * Assess gastric viability.
        * Perform gastropexy to prevent recurrence.
        * Explore the abdomen for other complications (e.g., splenic torsion).
    * **Procedure:**
        * **Midline celiotomy:** Incision from the xiphoid process to the pubis.
        * **Decompress the stomach:** If not already decompressed.
        * **Reposition the stomach:**
            * Grasp the pylorus and pull it ventrally and to the right.
            * Grasp the fundus and push it dorsally and to the left.
        * **Assess gastric viability:**
            * Evaluate the color and thickness of the stomach wall.
            * Look for areas of necrosis (black, thin, or easily torn areas).
            * If questionable viability, perform a gastric resection.
        * **Gastropexy:**
            * Attach the stomach to the abdominal wall to create a permanent adhesion.
            * Several techniques exist (e.g., incisional, belt-loop, circumcostal). Incisional gastropexy is common.
        * **Splenic assessment:**
            * Evaluate the spleen for torsion or congestion.
            * Splenectomy may be necessary if there is irreversible damage.
        * **Abdominal exploration:**
            * Examine the rest of the abdominal organs for any other abnormalities.

5.  **Post-operative Management:**

    * **Monitoring:**
        * Continue ECG monitoring for 24-72 hours.
        * Monitor vital signs (HR, RR, CRT, MM color) frequently.
        * Monitor urine output.
        * Assess pain level and provide analgesia (e.g., opioids, lidocaine CRI).
    * **Fluid Therapy:**
        * Continue IV fluids at a maintenance rate or slightly higher, adjusting based on hydration status and urine output.
    * **Electrolyte Monitoring and Correction:**
        * Monitor potassium levels and supplement as needed.
    * **Acid-Base Balance:**
        * Monitor blood gases or electrolytes and treat any significant acid-base disturbances.
    * **Antibiotics:**
        * Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for at least 24-48 hours post-operatively.
    * **Nutritional Support:**
        * Withhold food for 24-48 hours post-operatively.
        * Offer small amounts of water after 24 hours if the patient is not vomiting.
        * Begin feeding a bland, easily digestible diet in small, frequent meals after 48 hours.
        * Consider a feeding tube (esophagostomy or gastrostomy) for patients at high risk of aspiration or those that are not eating well.
    * **Activity:**
        * Restrict activity to leash walks only for 10-14 days.
    * **Complications:**
        * **Arrhythmias:** Continue to monitor and treat as needed.
        * **Sepsis:** Monitor for signs (fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, leukocytosis) and treat aggressively with antibiotics, fluids, and supportive care.
        * **Pancreatitis:** Monitor for vomiting, abdominal pain, and elevated pancreatic enzymes.
        * **Peritonitis:** Monitor for abdominal pain, fever, and leukocytosis.
        * **Aspiration pneumonia:** Monitor for coughing, increased respiratory effort, and abnormal lung sounds.
        * **Gastric dilatation:** Monitor for recurrence of distension.
        * **Short gastric artery thrombosis:** A rare but serious complication.
        * **Wound dehiscence:** Monitor the surgical incision.

**Prognosis:**

The prognosis for GDV depends on several factors:

* **Time to treatment:** The sooner the patient receives treatment, the better the prognosis.
* **Severity of gastric necrosis:** Patients with extensive gastric necrosis have a higher mortality rate.
* **Lactate levels:** High lactate levels (>6-9 mmol/L) are associated with increased mortality.
* **Presence of complications:** Complications such as sepsis, peritonitis, and arrhythmias worsen the prognosis.

With prompt and aggressive treatment, the survival rate for GDV can be 70-80%.
