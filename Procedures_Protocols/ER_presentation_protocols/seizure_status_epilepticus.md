## Veterinary Emergency Protocol: Canine/Feline Status Epilepticus (SE)

**Presenting Complaint:** Continuous seizure activity lasting more than 5 minutes, or recurrent seizures without full recovery of consciousness between episodes.

**Definition:** Status epilepticus (SE) is a medical emergency characterized by continuous seizure activity lasting more than 5 minutes, or recurrent seizures without full recovery of consciousness between episodes.

**Triage:**

1.  **Initial Assessment (within minutes):**
    * **Observation:** Presence of continuous seizure activity or recurrent seizures without recovery.
    * **ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation):** Ensure a patent airway. Intubation and oxygen supplementation may be necessary if respiratory compromise occurs. Monitor heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure. Establish intravenous (IV) access.
    * **Temperature Management:** Monitor body temperature. Hyperthermia is a common complication and may require cooling.
    * **Hypoglycemia Assessment:** Check blood glucose immediately. Administer dextrose IV if hypoglycemia is present.

2.  **Immediate Actions (0-10 minutes - First-line anticonvulsants):**
    * **First-Line Anticonvulsants (Benzodiazepines):** These are the fastest-acting drugs to stop active seizures.
        * **Diazepam (IV/PR):** 0.5-1.0 mg/kg IV slowly (can be repeated up to 3 times every 5-10 minutes). Can also be given per rectum (PR) at 1.0-1.5 mg/kg for dogs and 1-2 mg/kg for cats.
        * **Midazolam (IV/IM/IN):** 0.1-0.2 mg/kg IV/IM/IN (can be repeated). Often preferred for IM or intranasal due to better absorption.

**Stabilization:**

1.  **Second-Line Anticonvulsants (If seizures persist after benzodiazepines - within 15-30 minutes):**
    * **Levetiracetam (Keppra) (IV):**
        * **Dogs:** 30-60 mg/kg IV bolus over 5-10 minutes. Can be repeated every 8 hours.
        * **Cats:** 20-30 mg/kg IV bolus.
    * **Phenobarbital (IV):**
        * **Dogs:** 2-5 mg/kg IV every 15-30 minutes, slowly, up to a total loading dose of 15-20 mg/kg (or higher if needed). Monitor for respiratory depression and hypotension.
        * **Cats:** 2-4 mg/kg IV every 15-30 minutes, total loading dose typically 4-8 mg/kg.
    * **Potassium Bromide (KBr) (Oral/Rectal):** Very slow onset; primarily for long-term control rather than acute crisis.

2.  **Diagnostics:**
    * **Blood Work:** Complete blood count (CBC), chemistry, electrolytes, blood gas, ammonia, bile acids (if liver disease suspected).
    * **Urinalysis**.
    * **Imaging:** Thoracic radiographs, abdominal ultrasound (to look for systemic causes).
    * **Cardiac Monitoring:** Continuous ECG to monitor for arrhythmias.

3.  **Supportive Care:**
    * **Fluid Therapy:** Maintain hydration and blood pressure.
    * **Electrolyte Correction:** Supplement potassium if hypokalemic.

**Third-Line/Refractory Status Epilepticus (If seizures persist beyond 30-60 minutes - Anesthesia & CRIs):**

* **Propofol (IV CRI):**
    * **Bolus:** 1-2 mg/kg IV.
    * **CRI:** 0.1-0.6 mg/kg/min, titrate to effect.
    * Requires continuous monitoring and potentially mechanical ventilation.
* **Midazolam (IV CRI):**
    * **Bolus:** 0.1-0.2 mg/kg IV.
    * **CRI:** 0.05-0.5 mg/kg/hr, titrate to effect.
* **Pentobarbital (IV CRI):**
    * **Bolus:** 3-15 mg/kg IV to effect.
    * **CRI:** 0.5-5 mg/kg/hr.
    * Potent CNS depressant, requires close monitoring and likely mechanical ventilation.
* **Inhaled Anesthetics (e.g., Isoflurane, Sevoflurane):** Can be used for rapid control. Requires intubation and anesthetic machine.

**Brain Protection:**
* **Mannitol (IV):** 0.25-1.0 g/kg IV over 15-20 minutes, if increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is suspected.
* **Hypertonic Saline (IV):** Alternative for ICP reduction, especially if hypotensive.

**Identifying and Treating the Underlying Cause:**
* **Extracranial Causes:** Metabolic (hypoglycemia, hepatic encephalopathy, hypocalcemia, hypernatremia, hyponatremia), toxicities, systemic infections.
* **Intracranial Causes:** Structural (brain tumor, stroke, hydrocephalus), inflammatory/infectious (meningoencephalitis), idiopathic epilepsy.
* Advanced imaging (MRI of brain, CSF analysis) may be pursued after stabilization.

**Post-Crisis Management:**
* **Long-term Anticonvulsant Management:** Initiate oral maintenance anticonvulsant once acute seizures are controlled.

**Important Considerations:**
* **Anisocoria:** Can be post-ictal or indicate intracranial pathology/increased ICP.
* **Ketamine:** At dissociative doses (e.g., 3-5 mg/kg IV), generally considered safe for seizure management and does not typically increase ICP deleteriously in refractory SE.
* **Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of vital signs, seizure activity, and hydration status is critical.
* **Owner Communication:** Clear and frequent communication regarding prognosis, cost, and options (including referral) is vital.
