### Chest Tube

* **Indication**
  * Requiring multiple thoracocentesis within first few hours of presentation
  * Unable to achieve negative pressure

* **Risks**
  * See thoracocentesis

* **Procedure – Classic**
  1. Perform with either sedation/local anesthesia or general anesthesia
  2. Select a chest tube approximately the same size as the mainstem bronchus
  3. Prep entire lateral thorax
  4. Have an assistant grab the skin at the level of the shoulder blade and pull cranially
  5. Using lidocaine, block the skin down to the pleura at the 7th–9th intercostal space
  6. Make a stab incision slightly larger than the tube
  7. Use hemostats to bluntly dissect down to the intercostal space, then push hemostats into the thorax
  8. Place the chest tube in a cranioventral direction using the stylet to guide the tube (usually 4–6 inches)
  9. Place a clamp and/or three-way stopcock
  10. Release the skin to create a subcutaneous tunnel
  11. Secure the tube to the periosteum of the ribs with simple interrupted sutures to close the subcutaneous space around the tube; use a finger trap to secure the tube to the patient
  12. Place TAO and then cover with a bandage (stockinettes are handy)
  13. Use either a three-way stopcock for intermittent aspirations or a continuous suction system

* **Procedure – Mila Chest Tube**
  1. Watch the instructional video on YouTube
  2. Perform with sedation and local anesthesia
  3. Prep entire lateral thorax
  4. Place the over-the-needle plastic catheter at the 7th or 8th intercostal space
  5. Once in the pleural space, remove the needle and leave the plastic catheter in place
  6. Pass a guidewire through the plastic catheter and into the pleural space (~8–12 inches)
  7. Once the wire is in place, carefully remove the plastic catheter, holding the guidewire in place
  8. Advance the chest tube over the guidewire until it enters the pleural space to the marked hub
  9. Remove the guidewire and attach a syringe at the end of the chest tube
  10. Secure the chest tube to the chest with sutures
