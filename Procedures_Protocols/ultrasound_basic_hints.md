# **Basic Abdominal Ultrasound Hints**

* **Probe Marker:** Point cranial or right.
* **Video Clips:** Transverse videos should be from cranial to caudal. Sagittal videos should be from right to left for single structures or from medial to lateral for paired structures.
* **For Each Area:** Adjust the gain, TGC, and Map to optimize the image. Increase the frequency for shallow organs and decrease it for deep organs.
* **Lesions:** Take still images and videos of each abnormality in both sagittal and transverse views. Measure the length, width, and/or height.
* **Gain:** This refers to brightness. Adjust it to clearly see the borders of structures, starting at 50-60% for the abdomen.
* **Map:** This controls the shades of gray and the distribution of dark and light grays. Increase it for more whites and decrease it for more blacks.
* **TGC (Time Gain Compensation) Levers:** These allow for fine adjustment of the gain by zones of depth on the screen.

# **Focused Exam - Liver & Gall Bladder (GB)**

* **Probe:** A curvilinear probe is most often used, but a linear probe can be used for small animals for better detail.
* **Harmonics:** Off for the liver, but on for the gallbladder.
* **Depth:** The diaphragm should be one-third of the way down to the bottom of the screen.
* **Evaluate:** Note if the interrogation is incomplete and the reason (e.g., air in the stomach, food, uncooperative patient). Check liver shape and margins. Evaluate the GB wall thickness, contents (sludge, stones, mass), size, and tortuosity of the common bile duct. Measure the size of the GB if enlarged, the GB wall if thickened, the common bile duct if enlarged, and any masses or nodules. Check the size of the hepatic vein and caudal vena cava. Note the portal vein wall prominence and the presence of ascites.
* **Relative Echogenicity:** The liver should be hypoechoic to fat and the spleen, and hyperechoic to the renal cortex. The liver's echotexture is less coarse than fat and more coarse than the spleen.
* **Normal Measurements:** The GB wall should be <2-3mm in dogs and <1mm in cats. The common bile duct should be <4mm.
* **Differential Diagnoses (DDx):**
    * **Hyperechoic liver:** Steroid hepatopathy, lipidosis, fibrosis, neoplasia.
    * **Hypoechoic liver:** Passive congestion, acute inflammation/necrosis, neoplasia.
    * **Mottled echotexture:** Chronic necrosis/toxicosis/inflammation, diffuse abscess/granuloma, neoplasia, nodular hyperplasia.
* **Hints:** Elongate the GB as much as possible on sagittal video. For deep-chested dogs or those with a full stomach, try intercostal approaches. Hold the probe like an ice cream scoop, not a pencil.
* **Location:** The liver is caudal to the diaphragm and cranial to the stomach, kidneys, and spleen. The GB is in the right liver lobe, lateral to the porta hepatis.

# **Focused Exam - Spleen**

* **Probe:** Linear. **Harmonics:** off.
* **Depth:** The head of the spleen should extend to but not run off the bottom of the screen.
* **Evaluate:** Check margins (normally smooth and hyperechoic). Note if it's markedly enlarged. Look for masses and infarcts (triangular). Evaluate blood flow at the splenic vein with color Doppler. Measure any present nodules.
* **Relative Echogenicity:** The spleen should be hypoechoic to fat and hyperechoic to the liver and renal cortex. The spleen's echotexture is finer than the liver and fat.
* **DDx Focal Lesions:** Cyst, abscess, granuloma, necrotic tumor, neoplasia, hematoma, extramedullary hematopoiesis, nodular hyperplasia, lymphoid hyperplasia, and infarct (wedge-shaped).
* **Hints:** The landmark for the hilus is the "whale tail" splenic vein. There is a risk of hemorrhage if FNA is performed on a cavitated lesion or one with flow on color Doppler. Splenomegaly in cats is usually pathologic (>1cm in width). If you can't find the cat's spleen, check under the costal arch using an intercostal approach.
* **Location:** The spleen is caudal to the left liver lobe, caudal to the stomach fundus, and ventral to the left kidney.

# **Focused Exam - Urinary (Kidneys and Urinary Bladder)**

* **Probe:** Linear for the bladder and for kidneys in small dogs and cats. Curvilinear for kidneys in larger dogs.
* **Harmonics:** On for the bladder, off for the kidneys.
* **Depth:** The bladder should extend to the depth of the screen; use light pressure to avoid flattening it. The kidney should extend to half or more of the screen depth.
* **Evaluate:**
    * **Bladder:** Check for retroperitoneal fluid, ascites, intact wall, wall thickness, wall masses, stones, and clots. Check for the "snowglobe" sign by bouncing. Ureteral jets may be visible at the trigone.
    * **Kidneys:** Check margins (normally smooth). Note relative echogenicity, masses/cysts in the cortex, retroperitoneal fluid, subcapsular fluid, ascites, stones, pelvic mineralization, medullary rim sign, and infarcts (triangular).
* **Measurements:** Measure the thickness of the cortex (C) and medulla (M) and calculate the C:M ratio. Measure the length of each kidney and each renal pelvis.
* **Relative Echogenicity:** The renal cortex should be hypoechoic to fat, spleen, and liver, and hyperechoic to the medulla.
* **DDx Wall Thickening or Masses:** Cystitis, neoplasia.
* **Normal Measurements:** Kidney length is 30-44mm in cats and 2.5-3.5xL2 in dogs. Normal C:M ratio is 1:1. Normal pelvis is <3mm in cats and <4mm in dogs. Normal ureters are <2mm.
* **Fosgate Formula for bladder volume:** length (cm) x width (cm) x height (cm) x 0.63 = urine volume (ml).
* **Hints:** If the "snowglobe" sign is seen, take a urinalysis. Change the patient's position to use gravity to distinguish intraluminal clots from wall masses. Look for acoustic shadowing to differentiate stones from soft tissue masses. Ease pressure to distinguish stones from the colon.
* **Location:** The bladder is in the caudal-most abdomen. Both kidneys are where the costal arch meets the paralumbar muscles. The right kidney is caudal to the caudate liver lobe. The left kidney is ventral and medial to the head of the spleen, and caudal to the left liver lobe and stomach fundus. If you can't find the bladder, check caudally underneath the pelvis or re-check in 2 hours after hydration. If you can't find a kidney, try a lateral paralumbar approach.

# **Advanced Abdominal Ultrasound Hints**

# **Focused Exam - Gastrointestinal: Stomach, Duodenum, Small Bowel, Feline Ileum, Colon**

* **Probe:** Linear. **Harmonics:** On.
* **Depth:** The stomach ventral wall should be at half the screen depth. Duodenum should be at 4-6 cm depth. Small bowel should be at the dorsal body wall and one-third down the screen depth.
* **Evaluate:** Only evaluate the colon if it is abnormal. Evaluate the feline ileum only if it is seen, noting the prominent submucosa. Note the lumen diameter and measure if it is >1cm. Note variations in wall thickness. Submucosal short axis striping can indicate lymphangiectasia. The obliteration of normal layering indicates infiltrative disease like phycomycosis or neoplasia.
* **Measure:** Stomach wall thickness, duodenum mucosa/muscularis/wall thicknesses, and small bowel mucosa/muscularis/wall thicknesses.
* **Count:** Count motility for 3 minutes in the stomach, duodenum, and small bowel. Divide by 3 to get peristaltic waves per minute.
* **Normals:**
    * **Small Bowel Layers:** White lumen, black mucosa, white submucosa, black muscularis, white serosa.
    * **Motility:** Stomach: 3-6 peristaltic waves per minute. Small bowel: 1-3 peristaltic waves per minute.
    * **Dog Wall thickness:** Stomach: 3-5mm; Duodenum: 2-6mm; Jejunum: 2-5mm; Colon: 2-4mm.
    * **Cat Wall thickness:** Stomach: 1-3mm; Pylorus: 2-4mm; Duodenum: 1.5-3.5mm; Jejunum: 1.5-3.5mm; Colon: 1-2.5mm.
    * **Mucosa:Muscularis Ratio:** >1.6:1.
    * **Small Bowel Luminal Diameter:** <1.5cm.
* **Obstruction Indicators:** Segmental fluid distension, non-uniform peristalsis, hyper- and hypo-motility in the same animal, and hypermotility without content progression. Note that the last two can also be seen with non-obstructive motility disorders.
* **Hints:** Use plenty of gel to avoid black acoustic shadow artifacts on videos. Take measurements on long axis still images. Avoid rugal folds when measuring stomach wall thickness. Try standing, sternal, or lateral positions for dorsal stomach wall masses.
* **Landmarks:**
    * **Stomach:** Caudal to the liver, cranial to the left limb of the pancreas and transverse colon. The pylorus is near the gallbladder and orad to the duodenum. The body is between the pylorus and fundus. The fundus is near the head of the spleen and the left kidney.
    * **Duodenum:** Medial and parallel to the right abdominal wall, ventral to the right kidney, and lateral to the ascending colon.
    * **Small Bowel:** Found throughout the abdomen.
    * **Ascending Colon:** Medial to the duodenum and the right limb of the pancreas.
    * **Transverse Colon:** Caudal to the stomach and the left limb of the pancreas.
    * **Descending Colon:** Dorsal to the bladder, ventral to the left kidney.

# **Focused Exam - Pancreas**

* **Probe:** Linear. **Harmonics:** usually on.
* **Depth:** The pancreas should be in the center of the screen depth.
* **Evaluate:** Relative echogenicity (should be isoechoic with fat). Echotexture (should be more lobular than fat). Note if there is a hyperechoic halo, which can indicate pancreatitis. Look for hyper- or hypoechoic foci, local fluid, and mineralization.
* **Measure:** Measure the thickness if it is >1cm.
* **Normal Thickness:** <1 cm.
* **Landmarks:**
    * **Right limb:** Dorsal to the duodenum, ventral to the right kidney, and lateral to the ascending colon.
    * **Body:** Medial to the pylorus, near the common bile duct.
    * **Left limb:** Caudal to the greater curvature of the stomach, cranio-medial to the left kidney, caudo-medial to the head of the spleen, and cranial to the transverse colon.

# **Focused Exam - Adrenal Glands**

* **Probe:** Linear in small dogs and cats. Curvilinear in larger dogs. **Harmonics:** off.
* **Depth:** The aorta and/or cava should be one-third of the way down the screen.
* **Evaluate:** Size, shape, masses, and mineralization.
* **Measure:** Measure each adrenal gland's length and width at the widest point (usually the caudal pole in dogs and the middle in cats).
* **Normals:** <4-5mm wide (cat), <7-8mm wide (dog).
* **Hints:** Mineralized adrenals in dogs are often neoplastic, but normal cat adrenals can be mineralized. Bilateral adrenals >7-8mm in dogs are 77% specific and 80-90% sensitive for PDH. If you can't find the adrenals, try a lateral lumbar approach. Use color Doppler to distinguish them from vessels. If you see the medulla, you have likely found the adrenal gland.
* **Landmarks:**
    * **Left Adrenal:** Start at the cranial pole of the left kidney and fan medially. If you pass through the aorta, you have missed it, so fan back. The left adrenal gland usually sits just cranial to the left renal artery. The left phrenicoabdominal vein causes the peanut shape.
    * **Right Adrenal:** Start at the cranial pole of the right kidney and fan medially to pass through the cava. The right adrenal gland usually sits between the cava and the aorta. If you have passed through the aorta, you have missed it, so fan back.

# **Focused Exam - Iliac Lymph Nodes & Aortic Bifurcation**

* **Probe:** Linear. **Harmonics:** On.
* **Depth:** The aorta should be at the center of the screen depth.
* **Evaluate:** Doppler flow in the terminal aorta and caudal vena cava. If the iliac lymph nodes are enlarged, measure the largest one. Look for retroperitoneal fluid.
* **Normals:** Lymph nodes are <5mm in thickness. >1cm is markedly enlarged. >2-3cm is usually neoplasia.
* **Hints:** If you can't find the lymph nodes, try a lateral paralumbar approach. Normal lymph nodes are isoechoic to fat.
* **Landmarks:** The bifurcation of the aorta is ventral to the neck of the urinary bladder. The medial iliac lymph nodes sit among the terminal aortic branches.

# **Focused Exam - Reproductive: Ovaries, Uterus, Pregnancy, Testicles, Prostate**

* **Probe:** Either linear or curvilinear. **Harmonics:** off for all but early pregnancy.
* **Depth:** The organ of interest should be at the center of the screen depth.
* **Evaluate:** Check for the presence of ovaries, uterus, testicles, and pregnancy. Note the size, shape, and echotexture of the prostate. Note any masses or fluid in the uterus.
* **Normal Measurements:** Normal prostate size is 1/2 to 2/3 the pelvic inlet (check on x-rays). Normal uterus is <1cm in width. A post-partum uterus is 3-5cm and involutes by 3-4 weeks.
* **Hints:** Ovaries >3cm are likely neoplastic.
* **Pregnancy:**
    * **Gestational age <40 days:** GA = (6 x GSD) + 20 or GA = (3 x CRL) + 27, where GSD is gestational sac diameter and CRL is crown-rump length.
    * Fetal intestinal motility indicates imminent birth.
    * **Fetal Heart Rate:**
        * >190: Minimal stress.
        * 160-180: Mild distress.
        * 140-160: Moderate distress, with a risk of death if not delivered within 2-3 hours.
        * <140: Severe distress; death is imminent without a C-section.
* **Landmarks:**
    * **Ovaries:** Located up to 3 cm caudal to the caudal pole of the ipsilateral kidney and are hypoechoic to fat.
    * **Uterus:** The uterine body is found ventral to the neck of the urinary bladder, and each horn runs from there to the ipsilateral kidney.
    * **Cryptorchid Testicles:** Can be found anywhere from the inguinal ring to the caudal pole of the ipsilateral kidney.
