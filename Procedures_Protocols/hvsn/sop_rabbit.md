# Rabbit Spay/Neuter SOP

Revised 2023/03 Sherry Blenden DVM [cite: 1]

Normal vitals: Temperature $38.5-40.0^{\circ}C$ Heart Rate: 135-325 bpm Respiratory Rate: 30-60 bpm [cite: 1]

Only rabbits owned by PHS will be spayed or neutered, (ie no publicly owned rabbits) [cite: 1]

Anesthetic risk is higher in rabbits, studies report risk of death between 0.73% and 4.8%[cite: 2], compared to healthy dogs $0.009\%^{\circ}/_{o}^{3}-0.05\%^{1}$ and cats with a risk of $0.05\%^{\circ}/_{0}^{3}-0.11\%^{1}$[cite: 1].

* Potential causes for rabbit mortality: [cite: 1]
    * Stress - handling, during induction [cite: 1]
    * Hypothermia - large surface area to body weight ratio [cite: 1]
    * Subclinical respiratory diseases (e.g., Pasteurella multocida) [cite: 1]
    * Difficulty securing an airway with traditional endotracheal tubes (ETT) [cite: 1]
    * Inaccurate weights - relative drug overdose [cite: 1]
    * Obesity - altered distribution [cite: 2] of drugs and respiratory compromise [cite: 2]
    * Unfamiliarity with the species [cite: 2]

* Surgery on rabbits will only be performed when there is sufficient staff and time to allow more in-depth monitoring. [cite: 2]
* Rabbits must be at least 1 kg in weight and 3 months of age prior to surgery. [cite: 3]

## Rabbit Handling and Restraint

Correct handling techniques must be used by everyone in the anesthesia care team to prevent a rabbit from injuring its back (vertebral fracture) if it struggles while restrained and "thumps" its hind legs. [cite: 4]
* Using towels to wrap them firmly is a simple and effective technique which can be used during examination, premedication, induction of anesthesia, and in recovery. [cite: 5, 6]

* C-Position [cite: 6]
    * Slide your right (dominant) hand under the chest and start lifting up while your left (non-dominant) hand simultaneously slides down the back and under the rump to support the rear end. [cite: 6]
    * With a nervous bunny, you may lean over while doing this, so you can bring the rabbit's backside close to your chest, thus providing more support and security for the bunny. [cite: 7]
    * As you straighten up, keep the rabbit's back against your chest and you are now holding the rabbit in "C-position." [cite: 8] This is called C-position because the rabbit's body is basically in a curved "C", one hand holding the front end, the other hand supporting the rear end. [cite: 9]

* Bunny Burrito Towel Wrap [cite: 10]
    * Place the rabbit in the center of a regular-sized bath towel. [cite: 10]
    * Pull the front edge of the towel over his front feet and snuggle it under his chin. [cite: 11]
    * While keeping an arm over his back, one side of the towel is wrapped over his body. [cite: 12]
    * The hand on his back holds the towel snuggly around his neck, while the other hand pulls the rear edge of the towel up over his back. [cite: 13]
    * The side part of the towel is folded in on itself to reduce bulkiness. [cite: 14]
    * The opposite side of the towel is then pulled snuggly over the body. [cite: 15]

## Preanesthetic Preparation

* Rabbits are a prey species and are easily stressed in a hospital environment. [cite: 16] Rabbits will stay in their standard cage with food and water available (no fasting) until transferred to PRSNC for surgery. [cite: 17]
* The weight, clinical history and physical examination will be performed in a low stress environment to minimize stress and stress induced changes in heart rate and respiratory rates. [cite: 18]
* During the physical exam the veterinarian must listen carefully to the lungs and look for nasal discharge because clinical or subclinical respiratory diseases are common; [cite: 19] if this is present or suspected, elective procedures should be postponed until after treatment. [cite: 20]
* During the physical exam the veterinarian and/or technician must confirm the sex of the rabbit. [cite: 21] If the rabbit is fractious or nervous this can be performed after sedation. [cite: 22]

## Sedation/induction of anesthesia

A combined injectable sedation-induction "Bunny Magic" protocol is used. [cite: 23]
* Dexdomitor $0.5~mg/ml$ $0.1~mg/kg$ $(100~mcg/kg)$ [cite: 24]
* Ketamine 100 mg/mL 5 mg/kg [cite: 24]
* Methadone $10~mg/mL$ $0.5~mg/kg$ or Buprenorphine $0.3~mg/mL$ $0.05~mg/kg$ [cite: 24]
* Combined all 3 drugs into 1 syringe [cite: 24]
* Administer IM in the hind limb or lumbar muscles [cite: 24]
* Reverse with full dose of antisedan as soon as surgery is complete [cite: 24]
* Metacam $5~mg/mL$ $1~mg/kg$ SC at the time of sedation or if fractious, when sufficiently sedated. [cite: 24]
* Metacam $1~mg/kg$ PO $q24\times3$ days post-surgery [cite: 25]

The rabbit must be directly monitored once sedation is administered[cite: 25].

## Surgical Prep

* Place on a towel or blanket to reduce hypothermia [cite: 25]
* Clean any food out of the mouth and cheeks with a cotton swab [cite: 25]
* Place a mask on the rabbit and pre-oxygenate on the non-rebreathing circuit (bain) [cite: 25]
* Lubricate the eyes [cite: 25]
* Place socks on the feet and ears to reduce hypothermia [cite: 25]
* An IV catheter is recommended for emergency venous access [cite: 25]
    * Auricular (lateral) ear vein, cephalic, or saphenous vein [cite: 25]
* Place the rabbit in dorsal recumbency for surgical site preparation, [cite: 25]
    * Elevate the chest higher than the abdomen to improve lung function [cite: 25]
    * A towel may [cite: 26] be placed under the chest for elevation. [cite: 26]
* Confirm the sex of the rabbit [cite: 26]

### Spays

* Shave from just above the umbilicus to the pubis [cite: 26]
* Shave laterally approximately 2 cm lateral to the nipples [cite: 26]
* Bupivacaine freezing [cite: 26]
    * Use the cat spay bupivacaine dose chart $(max~2~mg/kg)$ [cite: 26]
    * Inject bupivacaine subcutaneously approximately midway between the pubis and umbilicus (similar to cat spays) [cite: 26]
* Surgical Scrub- reference PRSNC surgical preparation protocol [cite: 26]

### Neuters

* Shave very carefully and lightly over each scrotum [cite: 26]
    * less is more, it is very easy to cut fragile rabbit skin! [cite: 27]
* Bupivacaine freezing [cite: 27]
    * Use the cat spay bupivacaine dose chart $(max~2~mg/kg)$ [cite: 27]
    * Adjust volume based on the size of the testicle [cite: 27]
    * Insert the 25g needle into the testicle, aspirate back to ensure you are not in a vessel. [cite: 28]
    * Inject $\frac{1}{2}$ of the bupivacaine into the testicle. Repeat for the 2nd testicle. [cite: 29]
* Surgical Scrub- reference PRSNC surgical preparation protocol [cite: 29]

## Surgical Monitoring

* Transfer the rabbit to the surgical suite [cite: 30]
* Place the rabbit on oxygen and isoflurane only if needed to increase anesthetic depth [cite: 30]
    * Use the non-rebreathing (bain) circuit. [cite: 31]
* Place the pulse oximeter on the rabbit's ear [cite: 31]
* Continuous anesthetic monitoring is required. [cite: 31]
* Respiratory rate - respiratory arrest is one of the most common causes of rabbit mortality under anesthesia. [cite: 32] Pay careful attention to decreasing respirations! Monitor continuously, record every 2-5 minutes. [cite: 33]
* Heart Rate - cardiac arrest is a common cause of rabbit mortality under anesthesia. Pay careful attention to bradycardia! [cite: 34] Monitor continuously, record every 2-5 minutes. [cite: 35]
* Temperature - hypothermia is a contributor to morality in rabbits, it is important to keep rabbits warm! [cite: 36] Monitor the temperature every 5 min under anesthesia. [cite: 36]
* Alert the veterinarian if any anesthetic changes are observed [cite: 36]
* Administer the full dose of Antisedan IM as soon as surgery is complete. [cite: 37]

## Surgery

* Aseptic technique must be maintained [cite: 37]
* Sterile surgical gloves, mask, and surgical hair cover required [cite: 37]
* Exact surgical technique is the veterinarian's preference [cite: 37]

## Post operative care

* Continuously monitor heart rate and respirations, recording every 5 min, until the rabbit is sternal. [cite: 38]
* Monitor temperature immediately post op, if hypothermic (< 37 C) alert the veterinarian [cite: 38]
* Record every 15 min until sternal [cite: 38]
* Once the rabbit is sternal it can be returned to a supervised cage. [cite: 39]
* Check the TPR and pain score at 30 min and 1 hr post-operatively [cite: 39]
* Perform a post-operative check, including TPR, prior to leaving for the day. [cite: 40]
* Ensure the rabbit is eating and passing pellets [cite: 40]
* Evaluate pain per the attached Rabbit Grimace Scale [cite: 40]
    * If score is equal or greater than $4/10$, alert the veterinarian [cite: 40]
    * Additional analgesia may be required [cite: 40]
* Prepare post operative Metacam $1~mg/kg$ PO $q24\times3$ days post-surgery [cite: 40]
* Ensure PHS staff is familiar with and has a copy of rabbit post-operative care instructions [cite: 40]
