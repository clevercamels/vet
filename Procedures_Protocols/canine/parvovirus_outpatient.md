# Parvoviral Enteritis - Outpatient Treatment Protocol

## Overview

This protocol outlines a cost-effective outpatient management approach for puppies diagnosed with parvoviral enteritis, intended for cases where intensive inpatient care is not feasible or declined by the owner. This approach aims to provide supportive care and reduce the severity of symptoms, though it carries a higher mortality risk compared to inpatient treatment.

## Patient Criteria

* Puppies diagnosed with parvoviral enteritis confirmed by a positive parvovirus test.

* Mild to moderate clinical signs (e.g., lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea) without severe dehydration or significant electrolyte imbalances.

* Owners committed to providing diligent at-home care, including frequent fluid administration and monitoring.

* Exclusion of puppies with severe hypoglycemia, severe anemia, or signs of septic shock.

## Treatment Protocol

* **Initial Stabilization (Clinic Visit):**

  * **Fluids IV:**

    * IV Catheter placement (cephalic vein).

    * Lactated Ringer's Solution IV Bolus over 15min based on estimated blood volume loss:

      * 15% (mild inc HR): 15ml/kg.

      * 15-30% (inc HR/RR): 25ml/kg.

      * 30-40% severe (inc HR/RR/CRT/pale MM, cold extremities, mental dullness): 35ml/kg.

    * If hypoglycemic: Dextrose (500mg/ml) 0.75ml/kg IV slowly (diluted 1:4).

  * **Antibiotics:** Convenia (cefovecin 80mg/ml) 8mg/kg SQ.

  * **Anti-emetic:** Cerenia (maropitant 10mg/mL) 1mg/kg SQ.

  * **GI Support:** Vitamin B12 (cobalamin 1000mcg/ml) 0.25ml SQ.

* **Subsequent Days:**

  * **Subcutaneous Fluids:** Lactated Ringer's Solution 40ml/kg SQ daily.

  * **Anti-emetic:** Cerenia (maropitant 10mg/mL) 1mg/kg SQ, daily.

  * **Nutritional Support:**

    * Corn syrup (1ml for small dogs; 5ml for large dogs) every 4 hours until eating well.

    * Purina CN canned food: Feed 1ml/kg every 6 hours, starting 8-12 hours after initial treatment.

## Outcome Criteria

* Success defined as resolution of vomiting and diarrhea, return to normal appetite and activity level, and discharge from daily veterinary monitoring.

* A higher mortality rate is expected with outpatient management compared to intensive inpatient care.

* Close monitoring for worsening symptoms is critical, as rapid deterioration can occur.

## Clinical Application

This protocol provides a practical, cost-sensitive option for managing parvovirus in puppies when full hospitalization is not an option. It emphasizes aggressive initial fluid therapy and continued supportive care at home. Owners must be fully aware of the increased risks associated with outpatient treatment and the importance of strict adherence to the protocol and vigilant monitoring.
