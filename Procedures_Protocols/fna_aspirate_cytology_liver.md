# **Liver Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology**

* **Patient Preparation:**
    * Platelet count should be $>50,000/\text{ul}$.
    * BMBT (buccal mucosal bleeding time) should be $<2$ minutes.
    * PT/PTT and an ultrasound to check for hypoechoic areas in the liver are optional if available.
    * Light sedation is rarely needed for fractious animals.
    * The liver FNA should ideally be performed prior to noon.

* **Supplies:**
    * 1-1/2-inch x 22g-25g needles
    * 10-12cc syringes
    * Glass slides
    * Diff Quick or equivalent stains
    * Microscope and immersion oil

* **Liver Aspirate (Patient in Dorsal Recumbency):**
    * Shave and prep a 3x3-inch area just to the left of the sternum, at the costal arch.
    * Introduce the needle in the angle between the xyphoid and the left costal arch, pausing after it penetrates the skin.
    * Direct the needle cranially at a $45^\circ$ angle to the tabletop surface. The pet may jump during this stage.
    * When the patient is still, advance the needle as deep as possible to the hub, and then withdraw it without redirecting.
    * Forcefully blow the contents onto a glass slide by filling a 10-12cc syringe with air, attaching it to the needle, and blowing the contents out. A normal aspirate yields a drop of blood.
    * Prepare vertical and horizontal pull-apart slides gently to avoid cell trauma.
    * Stain the slides as desired.
    * Confirm that adequate liver cells are on the slide. If you only get peripheral blood, repeat the procedure. If you only get fat, try ultrasound guidance or introduce the needle more laterally.

* **Liver Aspirate (Through the Left Caudal Lung Lobe):**
    * This method is for deep-chested or obese dogs, and patients with small livers, with the patient in right lateral recumbency.
    * Shave and prep a 3x3-inch area in the 8th intercostal space, one-third of the way from dorsal to ventral.
    * Introduce the needle in the center of the prepped area, directing it toward the right (down) shoulder. Pause immediately after penetrating the skin, as the pet may jump at this stage.
    * When the patient is still, advance the needle as deep as possible to the hub and then withdraw it without redirecting. If you hit a rib, withdraw and try again 0.5-1 cm more cranially or caudally.
    * Fill a 10-12cc syringe with air, attach it to the needle, and forcefully blow the contents onto a glass slide. A normal aspirate will yield a drop of blood.
    * Gently prepare vertical and horizontal pull-apart slides to avoid cell trauma.
    * Stain as desired.
    * Confirm adequate liver cells are on the slide. If you only get peripheral blood, repeat to get another sample. If you only get fat, try ultrasound guidance or a longer needle.

* **Post-Procedure:**
    * Perform an AFAST to confirm an abdominal fluid score (AFS) = 0 before sending the patient home.
    * Do not send the patient home until 4 hours after the liver FNA.
    * Monitor the patient for bleeding for 24 hours.
