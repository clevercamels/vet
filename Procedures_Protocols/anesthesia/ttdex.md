# General Rules of Using TTDex (by Dr. Jeff Ko)

1) For TTDex mixture = Add 2.5mL Dexomitor and 2.5mL Torbugesic (10 mg/mL) to 1 bottle of Telazol powder and use the dose chart shown here[cite: 3].
2) Alternatively draw up each drug (Telazol, Torb, Dexdom) separately and mix in the same syringe prior to injection[cite: 4].
3) Dose rate shown are all for intramuscular (IM) injection and can be considered as follows -
    a) 0.005 mL/kg for sick geriatric, sick pediatric and high risk patients[cite: 5]. Propofol and isoflurane are needed for endotracheal intubation and anesthesia maintenance[cite: 6].
    b) .01 mL/kg for mild-moderate sedation or healthy geriatrics or pediatrics [cite: 7]
    c) 0.02 mL/kg for profound sedation with minor surgical stimulation [cite: 7]
    d) 0.03 mL/kg (or 0.15 mL per 10 lbs) for surgical plane of anesthesia up to 40 minutes [cite: 7]
    e) 0.04 mL/kg for surgical duration up to 50 minutes [cite: 7]
    **Do not use high dose rate (more than 0.02 mL/kg) for high risk patients [cite: 7]
4) Rapid drug onset within 5-8 minutes after a single IM administration[cite: 8].
5) For intravenous injection (IV), use 1Â½ of the IM dose[cite: 9].
6) TTDex at 0.01 ml/kg, IV allows endotracheal intubation in dogs and cats within 30 seconds[cite: 10].
7) It is always a good idea to provide 100% oxygen via face mask or via endotracheal tube while sedated with TTDex[cite: 10].
8) About 75% of the dogs or cats can be intubated with 0.02 ml/kg, IM[cite: 11].
9) May cause respiratory depression include apnea with high dose (>=0.02 ml/kg) which usually resides subsides with surgical manipulation[cite: 12].
10) If surgery is to be longer than 30 minutes, the animal can be placed on 0.5-1% or higher % Isoflurane on an as needed basis[cite: 13].
11) The Dexdomitor within the TTDex can be reversed with Antisedan (give 1/2 volume of the TTDex dose IM or same volume as Dexdomitor used)[cite: 14].
12) Dogs may have tiletamine hangover if reverse in less than one hour after the TTDex administration[cite: 15]. Cats can be reversed anytime with minimal tiletamine side effects[cite: 16].
13) Buprenorphine, hydromorphone or morphine can be given during or at the end of the procedure because Torbugesic concentration likely to decrease and will have minimal impact (antagonism) on the subsequent opioid administration[cite: 17].
14) Sudden awakening can occur if painful procedures continues after 30 minutes of TTDex administration with minimal analgesia on board[cite: 18]. Actions should be taken by administering opioids, or adjusting % of inhalant (isoflurane or sevoflurane)[cite: 19]. For rough recovery (either due to delirium or pain) using micro-dose of Dexdomitor for immediate sedation[cite: 20].
    * To make up a micro-dose of Dexdomitor -
        * Take 0.1 ml of Dexdomitor (500 mcg/mL) and dilute with 0.9 ml of saline (or sterile water) to form 50 mcg/mL concentration of Dexdomitor solution[cite: 21].
        * Administer 0.1 mL per 10 lbs, IV of this diluted Dexdomitor-saline mixture to treat rough recovery[cite: 22]. This amounts to approximately one mcg/kg of Dexdomitor[cite: 22].
        * If no IV access, then give 0.3 mL per 10 lbs, IM[cite: 23].
        * Duration of this micro-dose is about 5-8 minutes at the most[cite: 24].
    * To differentiate delirium from pain-induced rough recovery -
        * If the animal returns vocalization 3-5 minutes after micro-dose of Dexdomitor- the animal is in PAIN! [cite: 25]
        * If it was due to delirium, the animal is calm after micro-dose Dexdomitor[cite: 26].
15) If combining drugs not possible, dose volume is 0.01ml/lb telazol, 0.005ml/lb butorphanol, and 0.005ml/lb dexdomitor (i.e. 0.1/0.05/0.05 per 10lb).
