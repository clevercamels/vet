# Twilight Sedation Protocol for Minor Procedures

## Goal: Achieve a relaxed, pain-free, calm patient for minor procedures without full general anesthesia.

## I. Sedation Administration:

1.  IV Catheter Placement: Strongly recommended for drug administration, fluid support (if needed), and emergency access.
2.  Administer Sedative/Analgesic Combination (IV or IM):
    * Common Choices & Dosages:
        * Dogs:
            * Dexmedetomidine (Dexdomitor®): 1-10 mcg IV or IM (lower end for IV, higher for IM, and healthy patients).
            * Butorphanol: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg IV or IM.
            * Buprenorphine: 0.01-0.03 mg/kg IV, IM.
            * Hydromorphone: 0.05-0.1 mg/kg IV or IM.
            * Acepromazine: 0.01-0.05 mg/kg IV or IM (max 1-3 mg total dose).
            * Midazolam: 0.1-0.2 mg/kg IV (often co-administered with an opioid or alpha-2 agonist).
        * Cats:
            * Dexmedetomidine (Dexdomitor®): 5-15 mcg IM (lower end for IV).
            * Butorphanol: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg IV or IM.
            * Buprenorphine: 0.01-0.03 mg/kg IV, IM, or transmucosally (buccal).
            * Hydromorphone: 0.05-0.1 mg/kg IV or IM.
            * "Kitty Magic" (IM combination):
                * Dexmedetomidine: 5-10 mcg IM
                * Butorphanol: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg IM
                * Ketamine: 2-5 mg/kg IM
    * Dose: Titrate to effect, starting with lower doses in compromised or older patients.
3.  Allow Time for Onset: Wait 5-15 minutes in darkend room for peak effect.

## II. Procedure & Monitoring:

1.  Patient Positioning & Preparation: Gently position the patient. Clip and surgically prep the area.
2.  Local Anesthetic Block:
    * Lidocaine 2%: Up to 2-4 mg/kg total dose. (Rapid onset, shorter duration)
    * Bupivacaine 0.5%: Up to 1-2 mg/kg total dose. (Slower onset, longer duration)
    * Combination: A 1:1 mix of Lidocaine and Bupivacaine is common for rapid onset and prolonged effect, ensuring the total combined dose doesn't exceed the safe limits for either drug.
    * Infiltrate the laceration site. Allow 5-10 minutes for onset.

## III. Recovery:

1.  Post-Procedure Pain Management: Administer additional systemic analgesia if needed (e.g., NSAID if appropriate, continued opioid).
2.  Reversal (Optional but Recommended):
    * Atipamezole (Antisedan®): If Dexmedetomidine was used, administer IM at a dose equal to the Dexmedetomidine dose in mcg (e.g., 10 mcg Dexmedetomidine reversed with 10 mcg Atipamezole).
    * Naloxone: If opioid effects are too profound (rarely needed for twilight sedation), 0.01-0.04 mg/kg IV, IM, or SC.
3.  Monitor Recovery: Place patient in a quiet, warm, monitored recovery area until fully ambulatory and vital signs are stable.
4.  Discharge Instructions: Provide clear post-operative care instructions, pain management plan, and "go-home" directions to owners.
