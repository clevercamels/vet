# Canine Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD)

## Definition
Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD) is a condition in which the cushioning discs between the vertebrae of the spinal column degenerate, leading to disc herniation or extrusion that can compress the spinal cord and cause neurological deficits.

## Species
Dog

## Breed Risk
Common in chondrodystrophic breeds such as Dachshunds, Beagles, Cocker Spaniels, and French Bulldogs. Can occur in non-chondrodystrophic breeds as well.

## Types (Hansen Classification)

### Hansen Type I
- **Description**: Acute extrusion of the nucleus pulposus through the annulus fibrosus into the vertebral canal.
- **Pathophysiology**: The nucleus becomes mineralized and bursts through the annulus, often due to trauma or degeneration.
- **Typical Breeds**: Chondrodystrophic breeds like Dachshunds.
- **Age of Onset**: Younger to middle-aged dogs (typically 3–6 years).
- **Clinical Course**: Sudden onset of clinical signs ranging from pain to paralysis.

### Hansen Type II
- **Description**: Chronic protrusion of the disc without rupture of the annulus fibrosus.
- **Pathophysiology**: The annulus thickens and bulges over time, gradually compressing the spinal cord.
- **Typical Breeds**: Large-breed, non-chondrodystrophic dogs like German Shepherds and Labradors.
- **Age of Onset**: Middle-aged to older dogs (typically >5 years).
- **Clinical Course**: Slow progression of neurologic signs, often with chronic pain.

### Hansen Type III (Acute Non-Compressible Disc Extrusion)
- **Description**: Also known as "high-velocity, low-volume" disc extrusion.
- **Pathophysiology**: Sudden extrusion of non-degenerate nucleus material at high velocity, usually during vigorous activity.
- **Typical Breeds**: Any breed; not restricted to chondrodystrophic types.
- **Clinical Course**: Acute onset, often with minimal or no persistent spinal cord compression. Prognosis often better with rest.

## Causes
Degeneration of intervertebral discs due to age, genetics, or conformation.

## Clinical Signs
- Back or neck pain  
- Reluctance to move or jump  
- Ataxia or weakness in limbs  
- Paresis or paralysis (unilateral or bilateral)  
- Loss of proprioception and deep pain perception  
- Urinary or fecal incontinence

---

## Diagnostics
- Neurologic examination to localize lesion  
- Radiographs may suggest disc space narrowing or mineralized discs  
- Advanced imaging (MRI or CT) for definitive diagnosis and surgical planning  
- Myelography if MRI/CT not available

## Treatment

### Medical Management (mild to moderate, non-surgical cases)
- **Strict cage rest**: 4–6 weeks  
- **Carprofen**: 2.2 mg/kg PO BID  
- **Meloxicam**: 0.1 mg/kg PO SID  
- **Gabapentin**: 10–20 mg/kg PO TID  
- **Methocarbamol**: 20–30 mg/kg PO TID  
- **Omeprazole**: 1 mg/kg PO SID  

**Injectable options** (for hospitalized or acute pain cases):  
- **Carprofen injectable**: 4.4 mg/kg SQ once daily  
- **Methocarbamol injectable**: 44–132 mg/kg IV slow, up to TID  
- **Buprenorphine**: 0.01–0.02 mg/kg IV or IM q6–8h  
- **Gabapentin** oral liquid may be compounded for small dogs if injectable not available

---

### Surgical Management (severe or refractory cases)
- **Procedure**: Hemilaminectomy or ventral slot depending on location  
- **Indications**: Lack of improvement with medical management, non-ambulatory status, loss of deep pain

**Post-Operative Medical Protocol**
- **Carprofen**: 2.2 mg/kg PO BID x 5–7 days  
- **Gabapentin**: 10–20 mg/kg PO TID x 7–14 days  
- **Methocarbamol**: 20–30 mg/kg PO TID x 5–7 days  
- **Buprenorphine**: 0.01–0.02 mg/kg IM or IV q8h for first 48 hours post-op  
- **Omeprazole**: 1 mg/kg PO SID while on NSAIDs  
- **Cold compress**: 10–15 min every 6–8 hours for 48 hours post-op  
- **Physical therapy**: Passive range of motion, assisted walking, hydrotherapy as directed

---

## Prognosis
- **Good** if ambulatory or deep pain positive at presentation  
- **Fair to guarded** if deep pain is lost for >48 hours  
- **Recurrence** is possible; long-term exercise restriction and weight management advised

---

## Follow-Up
- Recheck 2 weeks post-surgery or 4 weeks if medical management  
- Gradual reintroduction to activity over 6–8 weeks  
- Physical rehabilitation referrals beneficial for recovery

---

## Client Education
- Monitor for signs of relapse: limping, reluctance to move, urinary changes  
- Avoid jumping, stairs, and rough play  
- Maintain lean body weight  
- Consider ramps or harnesses for mobility assistance
