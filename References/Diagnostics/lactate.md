# Lactate

* **Species:** Canine, Feline

* **What it Measures:** Measures the concentration of lactate (lactic acid) in whole blood, plasma, or serum. Lactate is a byproduct of anaerobic metabolism, and elevated levels (hyperlactatemia) can indicate inadequate tissue oxygenation or impaired lactate clearance.

* **Indications:** Assessment of tissue perfusion and oxygenation status in critically ill or injured patients. Evaluation of shock (hypovolemic, septic, cardiogenic), severe anemia, trauma, sepsis, cardiopulmonary arrest, gastric dilation-volvulus (GDV), and other conditions causing poor tissue blood flow or oxygen delivery. Monitoring response to resuscitation and treatment. Prognostic indicator in various critical conditions.

* **Sample Type:** Whole blood (collected in a heparinized tube or syringe), plasma, or serum. Sample should be analyzed immediately or processed and chilled/frozen rapidly to prevent artifactual increases in lactate due to ongoing glycolysis in the sample. Avoid prolonged tourniquet use.

* **Normal Reference Ranges (Approximate):**
    * **Canine:** < 2.5 mmol/L (some sources suggest < 2.0 mmol/L at rest)
    * **Feline:** < 2.0 - 2.5 mmol/L (some sources report values up to 5.33 mmol/L in healthy cats, but < 2.0-2.5 is a common threshold for concern)
    * *Note: Reference ranges can vary slightly between laboratories and analyzers. Always consult the specific laboratory's provided reference intervals.*

* **Brief Interpretation Notes:**

  * **Elevated Lactate (Hyperlactatemia):** Indicates anaerobic metabolism is occurring, usually due to insufficient oxygen delivery to tissues (Type A hyperlactatemia, e.g., shock, severe anemia) or impaired lactate clearance (Type B hyperlactatemia, e.g., severe liver disease, certain toxins, or increased metabolic demand like seizures).

  * **Magnitude of Elevation:** Generally correlates with the severity of tissue hypoxia/hypoperfusion and can be a prognostic indicator (higher lactate often associated with poorer prognosis).

  * **Monitoring Trends:** Serial lactate measurements are valuable for assessing response to therapy. Decreasing lactate levels suggest improving tissue perfusion and oxygenation. Persistently high or rising lactate despite treatment is a poor prognostic sign.

  * **Normal Lactate:** Suggests adequate tissue perfusion and oxygenation at the time of sampling, but does not rule out localized or intermittent issues.

  * Interpretation must always be done in conjunction with the patient's clinical signs, physical examination findings (e.g., heart rate, pulse quality, mucous membrane color, capillary refill time), and other diagnostic parameters.
