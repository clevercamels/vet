# PrecisionPSL™ Pancreatic Lipase Assay – Antech Diagnostics

## 🧪 Test Name
**PrecisionPSL™ (Pancreatic Sensitive Lipase Assay)**

## 🐾 Purpose
Designed to detect elevated levels of pancreatic-specific lipase, the PrecisionPSL™ test assists in diagnosing pancreatitis by identifying inflammation or injury to the pancreas in both canine and feline patients.

## 📋 Sample Requirements
- **Sample Type:** Serum
- **Volume:** Minimum of 0.5 mL
- **Handling:** Avoid hemolysis and lipemia; fasting sample preferred but not mandatory.

## 🧬 Interpretation
While specific reference ranges for the PrecisionPSL™ test are proprietary, elevated levels of pancreatic-specific lipase are indicative of pancreatitis.

It's essential to interpret results in conjunction with clinical signs and other diagnostic findings.

## ⏱️ Turnaround Time
Typically, results are available within 1–2 business days from the time the sample is received at the laboratory.

## ⚠️ Limitations
- A single test should not be the sole basis for diagnosis; consider the complete clinical picture.
- Elevated lipase levels can occur in conditions other than pancreatitis; additional diagnostics may be necessary.
- Normal lipase levels do not entirely rule out pancreatitis, especially in early or mild cases.

## 📌 Clinical Application
The PrecisionPSL™ assay is a valuable tool for veterinarians to assess pancreatic health, particularly when pancreatitis is suspected. It should be used as part of a comprehensive diagnostic approach, including patient history, physical examination, imaging, and other laboratory tests.
