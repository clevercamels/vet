# Biochemistry Panel - Green Sea Turtle (Chelonia mydas)

* **Species:** Green Sea Turtle (Chelonia mydas)

* **What it Measures:** Evaluates various biochemical substances in the serum or plasma to assess organ function (kidney, liver), protein and nutritional status, electrolyte balance, and metabolic health. Similar to hematology, interpretation requires consideration of species-specific physiology and influencing factors. Common analytes include:
    * **Total Protein (TP), Albumin, Globulin:** Indicators of hydration, nutritional status, liver function, and immune response.
    * **Glucose:** Reflects carbohydrate metabolism and can be influenced by stress, diet, and metabolic state.
    * **Nitrogenous Waste Products (BUN, Uric Acid, Creatinine):** Assess kidney function. Uric acid is a major nitrogenous waste product in reptiles.
    * **Liver Enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, LDH):** Indicate liver or muscle damage/function. AST and CK are often elevated with muscle activity or damage, common in stranded turtles.
    * **Electrolytes (Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, Calcium, Phosphorus, Magnesium):** Assess hydration, osmoregulation, and various metabolic processes. Calcium and Phosphorus are important for bone health and can be influenced by diet and reproductive status (especially in females).
    * **Cholesterol, Triglycerides:** Can provide insight into nutritional status and metabolic health, influenced by diet and reproductive state.
    * **Bilirubin:** While present, interpretation differs from mammals; biliverdin is the primary bile pigment in reptiles, and plasma color (e.g., green tinge) can be a more obvious indicator of hepatobiliary issues.

* **Indications:** Assessment of systemic health, evaluation of organ dysfunction (kidney, liver), assessment of nutritional status, investigation of signs like lethargy, anorexia, weight loss, or abnormal behaviors. Monitoring response to rehabilitation, fluid therapy, and treatment. Pre-release health assessments.

* **Sample Type:** Serum (red top or serum separator tube) or Heparinized plasma (green top) tube. Lithium heparin is commonly used. Careful blood collection is essential to avoid lymphatic fluid contamination, which can dilute samples and affect results.

* **Normal Reference Ranges (Approximate and Highly Variable):**
    * *Note: Reference ranges for green sea turtles are highly variable and influenced by factors such as age/size class, geographic location, diet, sex, reproductive status, health status (wild vs. captive, presence of disease), and laboratory methodology. The ranges below are approximate and compiled from various studies; **always consult the specific laboratory's provided reference intervals** and interpret results in the context of the individual turtle's history, physical examination, and other diagnostics.*
    * **Total Protein:** 3.0 - 7.0 g/dL
    * **Albumin:** 1.0 - 3.0 g/dL
    * **Globulin:** 2.0 - 5.0 g/dL
    * **Glucose:** 50 - 150 mg/dL (can be elevated with stress)
    * **BUN:** 5 - 30 mg/dL (generally lower than uric acid)
    * **Uric Acid:** 1.0 - 10.0 mg/dL (can be higher with high protein diet or dehydration)
    * **Creatinine:** 0.1 - 1.0 mg/dL (less sensitive indicator of renal function than uric acid in reptiles)
    * **AST:** 50 - 500 U/L (highly variable, influenced by muscle activity/damage)
    * **ALT:** 5 - 50 U/L (less sensitive for liver disease in reptiles than AST)
    * **ALP:** 10 - 250 U/L (can be elevated in growing juveniles or with bone/liver issues)
    * **CK:** 100 - 2000+ U/L (often significantly elevated with muscle damage, handling, or stranding)
    * **Sodium:** 130 - 160 mmol/L
    * **Potassium:** 2.5 - 6.0 mmol/L
    * **Chloride:** 100 - 130 mmol/L
    * **Calcium:** 7.0 - 12.0 mg/dL (can be higher in reproductively active females)
    * **Phosphorus:** 2.0 - 7.0 mg/dL
    * **Cholesterol:** 50 - 300 mg/dL (can be higher in reproductively active females)
    * **Triglycerides:** 20 - 200 mg/dL (can be higher in reproductively active females)
    * **Bilirubin (Total):** Generally low, plasma color (yellow to green tinge) is more relevant.

* **Brief Interpretation Notes:**
    * **Proteins:** Low TP, Albumin, or Globulin can indicate malnutrition, protein loss (e.g., from gut or kidneys), or chronic disease. Elevated globulins can suggest chronic inflammation or immune stimulation.
    * **Glucose:** Hyperglycemia can be due to stress, while persistent hyperglycemia might suggest metabolic derangements. Hypoglycemia can be seen with sepsis or severe illness.
    * **Renal Parameters (Uric Acid, BUN, Creatinine):** Elevated uric acid is the primary indicator of impaired kidney function or dehydration. BUN and creatinine are less reliable in reptiles.
    * **Liver/Muscle Enzymes:** Elevated AST and CK are common with muscle damage (e.g., from stranding, handling, or trauma). Elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP, GGT) can suggest liver insult, but interpretation requires considering other factors.
    * **Electrolytes:** Imbalances can occur with dehydration, overhydration, kidney issues, or gastrointestinal disturbances. Calcium and phosphorus interpretation should consider age, diet, and reproductive status.
    * **Cholesterol/Triglycerides:** Can be elevated in healthy reproductively active females due to vitellogenesis. Abnormal levels in other contexts might suggest nutritional or metabolic issues.
    * Interpretation in green sea turtles requires expertise in reptile medicine and consideration of the numerous factors that can influence biochemical parameters in these animals.
