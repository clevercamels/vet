# Biochemistry Panel - Canine & Feline

* **Species:** Canine, Feline

* **What it Measures:** Measures various biochemical substances in the serum or plasma to assess organ function (kidney, liver, pancreas), electrolyte balance, protein levels, and metabolic status. Common analytes include:
    * BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen)
    * Creatinine
    * SDMA (Symmetric Dimethylarginine)
    * ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase)
    * ALP (Alkaline Phosphatase)
    * GGT (Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase)
    * AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase)
    * Bilirubin (Total, Direct, Indirect)
    * Albumin
    * Globulin
    * Total Protein
    * Glucose
    * Amylase
    * Lipase (often supplemented by species-specific tests like cPLI/fPLI)
    * Calcium
    * Phosphorus
    * Sodium
    * Potassium
    * Chloride
    * Cholesterol
    * Triglycerides

* **Indications:** Routine wellness screening, evaluation of systemic illness, monitoring chronic diseases (e.g., kidney disease, liver disease, diabetes), pre-anesthetic testing, investigation of signs like vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, increased thirst/urination, weight loss, or jaundice.

* **Sample Type:** Serum (collected in a red top or serum separator tube) or Heparinized plasma (collected in a green top tube). Fasting samples are often preferred for some analytes like glucose and triglycerides.

* **Normal Reference Ranges (Approximate):**
    * *Note: Reference ranges are laboratory-specific and can vary based on analyzer, methodology, and patient population (age, breed, lifestyle). Always consult the specific laboratory's provided reference intervals for accurate interpretation.*

        * Cholesterol: 136 - 392 mg/dL
        * Triglycerides: 23 - 102 mg/dL
    * **Feline:**
        * Total Protein: 6.6 - 8.4 g/dL
        * Albumin: 3.2 - 4.3 g/dL
        * Globulin: 2.9 - 4.7 g/dL
        * Glucose: 71 - 182 mg/dL (can be elevated with stress)
        * BUN: 17 - 35 mg/dL
        * Creatinine: 0.8 - 2.1 mg/dL
        * SDMA: 0 - 14 µg/dL
        * ALT: 28 - 109 U/L
        * ALP: 11 - 49 U/L (less likely to be elevated with bone issues than in dogs)
        * GGT: 0 - 2 U/L
        * AST: 17 - 48 U/L
        * Total Bilirubin: 0 - 0.1 mg/dL
        * Calcium: 9.0 - 11.3 mg/dL
        * Phosphorus: 2.6 - 5.5 mg/dL (can be higher in young cats)
        * Sodium: 149 - 158 mmol/L
        * Potassium: 3.8 - 5.5 mmol/L
        * Chloride: 111 - 124 mmol/L
        * Cholesterol: 101 - 323 mg/dL
        * Triglycerides: 30 - 106 mg/dL

* **Brief Interpretation Notes:**
    * **Kidney:** Elevated BUN, Creatinine, and SDMA suggest reduced kidney function. SDMA is often an earlier indicator than BUN and Creatinine.
    * **Liver:** Elevated ALT, ALP, GGT, and Bilirubin can indicate liver damage or dysfunction, or biliary issues. Low Albumin and BUN can also suggest chronic liver disease. ALP can be elevated in dogs due to various factors (e.g., steroid use, Cushing's disease) and is less specific for liver disease than in cats.
    * **Pancreas:** Elevated Amylase and Lipase can suggest pancreatitis, though species-specific tests (cPLI/fPLI) are more sensitive and specific.
    * **Glucose:** Elevated glucose (hyperglycemia) can indicate diabetes mellitus or stress (especially in cats). Low glucose (hypoglycemia) can be due to various causes including insulin overdose, sepsis, or certain tumors.
    * **Proteins:** Low Albumin can indicate liver disease, protein-losing nephropathy/enteropathy, or malnutrition. Elevated Globulins can suggest chronic inflammation or immune-mediated disease.
    * **Electrolytes:** Imbalances (e.g., high/low Sodium, Potassium, Chloride) can be caused by vomiting, diarrhea, kidney disease, Addison's disease, and other metabolic disturbances.
    * **Cholesterol/Triglycerides:** Can be influenced by fasting status, diet, and certain metabolic or endocrine diseases.
