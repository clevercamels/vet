# Complete Blood Count (CBC) - Green Sea Turtle (Chelonia mydas)

* **Species:** Green Sea Turtle (Chelonia mydas)

* **What it Measures:** Evaluates the cellular components of green sea turtle blood, including red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and thrombocytes. Due to fundamental differences from mammalian blood, automated analyzers designed for mammals are often not directly applicable. Evaluation typically involves manual methods and microscopic examination of blood smears. Key parameters include:
    * **Red Blood Cell Count (RBC):** Number of red blood cells. Sea turtles have nucleated RBCs.
    * **Packed Cell Volume (PCV) / Hematocrit (HCT):** Percentage of blood volume occupied by RBCs.
    * **Hemoglobin (HGB):** Concentration of hemoglobin in the blood.
    * **White Blood Cell Count (WBC):** Total number of leukocytes.
    * **Differential White Blood Cell Count:** Proportions and absolute numbers of different leukocyte types, which include:
        * Heterophils ( functionally analogous to mammalian neutrophils, often the predominant granulocyte)
        * Lymphocytes
        * Monocytes (can include melanomacrophages)
        * Eosinophils
        * Basophils
    * **Thrombocytes:** Nucleated cells involved in hemostasis (analogous to mammalian platelets). Often evaluated subjectively due to clumping.

* **Indications:** Assessment of overall health status, evaluation of anemia, infection, inflammation, stress, and response to rehabilitation or treatment. Hematology is a valuable tool in health assessments of both wild and captive sea turtles.

* **Sample Type:** Whole blood collected in an anticoagulant, typically Lithium Heparin (green top) or EDTA (lavender top), although heparin is often preferred in reptiles to minimize cell lysis. Sample collection site is commonly the dorsal cervical sinus. Careful, atraumatic collection is important to avoid sample dilution with lymphatic fluid.

* **Normal Reference Ranges (Approximate and Highly Variable):**
    * *Note: Reference ranges for green sea turtles can vary significantly based on geographic location, age/size class, health status (wild vs. captive, presence of disease like fibropapillomatosis), and the specific laboratory and methodology used. The ranges below are approximate and derived from various studies; always consult the specific laboratory's provided reference intervals and consider the individual turtle's context.*
    * **PCV/HCT:** 25 - 45%
    * **RBC:** 0.3 - 1.0 x $10^6$/µL
    * **HGB:** 7 - 16 g/dL
    * **WBC:** 1.0 - 9.0 x $10^3$/µL
    * **Differential WBC (Approximate Proportions):**
        * Heterophils: 40 - 70%
        * Lymphocytes: 20 - 50%
        * Monocytes: 0 - 10%
        * Eosinophils: 0 - 10%
        * Basophils: 0 - 5%
    * **Thrombocytes:** Often reported as adequate, decreased, or increased based on subjective evaluation of the blood smear due to clumping.

* **Brief Interpretation Notes:**
    * **RBCs/PCV/HGB:** Low values indicate anemia, which can be caused by various factors including parasitism, infectious disease, chronic illness, or environmental factors. High values are less common but can be seen with dehydration.
    * **WBCs (Total & Differential):** Elevated total WBCs, particularly heterophils (heterophilia), often indicate inflammation or infection. Changes in lymphocyte counts (lymphocytosis or lymphopenia) can also be significant. Eosinophilia may be seen with parasitic infections or allergic reactions. Monocytes, especially melanomacrophages, can increase with chronic inflammation or phagocytosis of cellular debris.
    * **Thrombocytes:** Decreased numbers (thrombocytopenia) can suggest increased consumption (e.g., with inflammation or DIC), decreased production, or increased destruction.
    * Morphologic changes in blood cells (e.g., toxic heterophils, reactive lymphocytes) are also important for interpretation.
    * Interpretation of sea turtle hematology requires familiarity with reptile hematology and consideration of the species-specific differences and potential influencing factors.
