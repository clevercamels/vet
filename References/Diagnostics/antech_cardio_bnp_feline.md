# ANTECH Cardio-BNP Test – Clinician Info Sheet (Feline)

## Test Name
**Cardio-BNP (NT-proBNP)**

## Purpose
Assesses **NT-proBNP**, a cardiac biomarker elevated in feline cardiomyopathies.  
Useful in identifying **asymptomatic cardiac disease** and **differentiating cardiac vs. non-cardiac causes of respiratory distress**.

## Indications
- Heart murmur or gallop rhythm on auscultation
- Dyspnea or tachypnea of unclear origin
- Suspected occult hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)
- Screening for cardiomyopathy in at-risk breeds (e.g., Maine Coon, Ragdoll)
- Pre-anesthetic assessment in mature or at-risk cats

## Sample Requirements
- **Serum** preferred (minimum 0.5 ml)
- **EDTA plasma** acceptable
- Ship chilled with ice pack; avoid hemolysis or lipemia

## Interpretation (Feline)
- **< 100 pmol/L**: Normal
- **100–270 pmol/L**: Borderline; monitor or refer for echocardiogram
- **> 270 pmol/L**: Suggestive of cardiomyopathy

## Limitations
- Not a substitute for echocardiography
- Elevated in systemic illness, hyperthyroidism, renal disease
- May not detect early or mild disease

## Turnaround Time
- 1–2 business days from sample receipt at lab

## Additional Notes
- Combine with clinical exam and thoracic imaging for best results
- Especially useful when echocardiography is not available or feasible
