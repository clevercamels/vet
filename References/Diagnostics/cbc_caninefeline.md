# Complete Blood Count (CBC)

* **Species:** Canine, Feline

* **What it Measures:** Evaluates red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets. Provides counts (e.g., RBC count, WBC count, Platelet count), indices (e.g., MCV, MCH, MCHC), hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit/PCV, and a differential count of WBC types (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils).

* **Indications:** Routine wellness screening, pre-anesthetic testing, evaluation of anemia, infection, inflammation, bleeding disorders, monitoring response to treatment, assessment of overall health status.

* **Sample Type:** Whole blood collected in an EDTA (lavender top) tube.

* **Normal Reference Ranges (Approximate):**
    * **Canine:**
        * RBC: 5.5 - 8.5 x $10^6$/µL
        * HCT: 37 - 55%
        * HGB: 12 - 18 g/dL
        * WBC: 6.0 - 17.0 x $10^3$/µL
        * Neutrophils: 3.0 - 11.4 x $10^3$/µL
        * Lymphocytes: 1.0 - 4.8 x $10^3$/µL
        * Monocytes: 0.15 - 1.35 x $10^3$/µL
        * Eosinophils: 0.1 - 0.75 x $10^3$/µL
        * Basophils: 0.0 - 0.1 x $10^3$/µL
        * Platelets: 200 - 500 x $10^3$/µL
    * **Feline:**
        * RBC: 5.0 - 10.0 x $10^6$/µL
        * HCT: 30 - 45%
        * HGB: 10 - 15 g/dL
        * WBC: 5.5 - 19.5 x $10^3$/µL
        * Neutrophils: 2.5 - 12.5 x $10^3$/µL
        * Lymphocytes: 1.5 - 7.0 x $10^3$/µL
        * Monocytes: 0.0 - 0.85 x $10^3$/µL
        * Eosinophils: 0.0 - 0.75 x $10^3$/µL
        * Basophils: 0.0 - 0.1 x $10^3$/µL
        * Platelets: 300 - 800 x $10^3$/µL
    * *Note: Reference ranges can vary significantly between laboratories, analyzers, and even patient populations (age, breed). Always consult the specific laboratory's provided reference intervals for accurate interpretation.*

* **Brief Interpretation Notes:**
    * **RBCs/HCT/HGB:** Low values indicate anemia (various causes: blood loss, hemolysis, decreased production). High values (polycythemia) can indicate dehydration or less commonly, other underlying conditions.
    * **WBCs (Total & Differential):** Elevated total WBCs often suggest infection or inflammation (especially neutrophils). Decreased total WBCs can indicate viral infections, bone marrow issues, or overwhelming sepsis. Changes in specific WBC types (e.g., lymphocytosis, eosinophilia) can point to specific disease processes (e.g., chronic infection, allergies, parasitism).
    * **Platelets:** Low counts (thrombocytopenia) increase bleeding risk and can be due to immune-mediated disease, infectious agents, or decreased production. High counts (thrombocytosis) are less common clinically significant but can occur with inflammation or other conditions.
