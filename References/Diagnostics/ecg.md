# Electrocardiogram (ECG) - Canine & Feline

* **Species:** Canine, Feline

* **What it Measures:** Records the electrical activity of the heart over time. This non-invasive test helps assess heart rate, rhythm, and provides information that can suggest chamber enlargement or conduction abnormalities. The typical ECG tracing consists of a P wave, QRS complex, and T wave, representing atrial depolarization, ventricular depolarization, and ventricular repolarization, respectively.

* **Indications:** Evaluation of suspected arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) detected during physical examination, investigation of signs like collapse or weakness, assessment for chamber enlargement, monitoring of anesthetized or critically ill patients, evaluation of electrolyte imbalances affecting the heart, and screening in breeds predisposed to heart disease.

* **Sample Type:** Non-invasive test performed by attaching electrodes to specific points on the patient's body, typically the limbs (right forelimb, left forelimb, left hindlimb, and a ground on the right hindlimb). The patient is usually in right lateral recumbency, though sternal recumbency may be used for cats. Minimal restraint is preferred, and sedation is generally avoided as it can affect heart rhythm.

* **Normal Findings (Approximate):**
    * *Note: Normal parameters can vary with breed, age, size, and individual patient factors (e.g., stress, respiratory cycle). Always consult a veterinary cardiology textbook or specialist for comprehensive interpretation.*
    * **Canine:**
        * **Heart Rate:** 60 - 180 beats per minute (bpm) at rest (can be lower in large breeds, higher in toy breeds and puppies)
        * **Rhythm:** Normal Sinus Rhythm or Sinus Arrhythmia (a normal, cyclic irregularity related to breathing)
        * **P wave:** Positive in Lead II, typically < 0.4 mV amplitude and < 0.04 seconds duration.
        * **PR interval:** 0.06 - 0.13 seconds (varies with heart rate)
        * **QRS complex:** Narrow, typically < 0.06 seconds duration (< 0.05 seconds in small breeds); amplitude varies with breed and size (R wave < 2.5-3.0 mV in Lead II).
        * **T wave:** Variable morphology (positive, negative, or biphasic) and amplitude; often in the same direction as the R wave.
    * **Feline:**
        * **Heart Rate:** 140 - 220 bpm (can be higher with stress)
        * **Rhythm:** Normal Sinus Rhythm
        * **P wave:** Positive in Lead II, typically < 0.2 mV amplitude and < 0.04 seconds duration.
        * **PR interval:** 0.05 - 0.09 seconds (varies with heart rate)
        * **QRS complex:** Narrow, typically < 0.04 seconds duration; R wave < 0.9 mV in Lead II.
        * **T wave:** Variable morphology (positive, negative, or biphasic).

* **Brief Interpretation Notes:**
    * **Arrhythmias:** Deviations from normal heart rate or rhythm (e.g., bradycardia, tachycardia, premature complexes, heart blocks, fibrillation) indicate abnormal electrical activity. The specific type of arrhythmia helps localize the problem and guide treatment.
    * **Chamber Enlargement:** Increased amplitude or duration of P waves or QRS complexes can suggest atrial or ventricular enlargement, respectively.
    * **Conduction Disturbances:** Prolonged intervals (e.g., PR interval) or abnormal QRS morphology can indicate delays or blocks in the electrical conduction system.
    * **Electrolyte Imbalances:** Severe electrolyte abnormalities (especially potassium) can cause characteristic changes in the ECG waveform.
    * ECG findings should always be interpreted in conjunction with the patient's clinical signs, physical examination findings, and other diagnostic results (e.g., thoracic radiographs, echocardiogram).
