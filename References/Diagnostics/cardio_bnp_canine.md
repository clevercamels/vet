# ANTECH Cardio-BNP Test – Clinician Info Sheet (Canine)

## Test Name

**Cardio-BNP (NT-proBNP)**

## Purpose

Evaluates **circulating levels of NT-proBNP**, a biomarker released by myocardial cells in response to stretch and stress.  
Used to **screen for or support diagnosis of cardiac disease**, particularly **occult cardiomyopathy** and **congestive heart failure**.

## Indications

* Increased resting respiratory rate or effort
* Heart murmur or arrhythmia on auscultation
* Syncope or exercise intolerance
* Breed predisposition to heart disease (e.g., Doberman, Boxer, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel)
* Distinguishing cardiac vs. respiratory causes of dyspnea
* Disease staging (probably reasonable to start Pimobendan with results >1500pmol/L)
* Monitor efficacy of CHF treatments
* Pre-anesthetic screening in at-risk breeds

## Sample Requirements

* **Serum** preferred (minimum 0.5 ml)
* **EDTA plasma** acceptable
* Ship cooled with ice pack; avoid hemolysis or lipemia

## Interpretation (Canine)

* **< 900 pmol/L**: Cardiac disease unlikely
* **900–1800 pmol/L**: Suspicious; recommend further cardiac evaluation (e.g., echocardiogram)
* **> 1800 pmol/L**: Cardiac disease likely; initiate cardiology referral or therapy

## Limitations

* Not a replacement for echocardiography
* Can be elevated in non-cardiac conditions (e.g., renal disease, hyperthyroidism, systemic hypertension, substantial dehydration)
* Negative result does not completely rule out early or mild heart disease
* Sensitivity 90%, Specificity 50-80%; i.e. increased false positives

## Turnaround Time

* 1–2 business days from sample receipt at lab

## Additional Notes

* Results best interpreted in conjunction with clinical signs, thoracic radiographs, and auscultation
* Particularly useful in primary care settings when echocardiography is not immediately available
