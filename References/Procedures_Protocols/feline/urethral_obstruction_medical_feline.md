# Urethral Obstruction in Male Cats: Non-Catheterization Management Protocol

## Overview
A clinical study evaluated a low-cost protocol to manage urethral obstruction (UO) in male cats **without urethral catheterization**, aimed at reducing cost and complications in cases where conventional care was declined.

## Patient Criteria
- Male cats with UO confirmed by clinical signs and diagnostics
- Exclusion of cats with urinary calculi or severe metabolic disturbances
- Radiographs and lab work performed prior to enrollment

## Treatment Protocol
- **Acepromazine**: 0.25 mg IM or 2.5 mg PO every 8 hours  
- **Buprenorphine**: 0.075 mg PO every 8 hours  
- **Medetomidine**: 0.1 mg IM every 24 hours  
- **Decompressive cystocentesis**: Performed as needed to relieve bladder pressure  
- **Subcutaneous fluids**: Administered as clinically indicated  
- **Environmental management**: Quiet, dark housing to reduce stress

## Outcome Criteria
- Success defined as spontaneous urination within 72 hours and discharge without catheterization
- 11 of 15 cats (73%) responded successfully to the protocol
- Treatment failure (n=4) was associated with:
  - More severe azotemia
  - Uroabdomen (3 cases)
  - Hemoabdomen (1 case)
- Necropsy revealed significant bladder inflammation but no rupture

## Clinical Application
This protocol offers a **cost-effective, minimally invasive alternative** to catheterization for select, stable male cats with UO. It may be particularly useful in cases where financial limitations would otherwise result in euthanasia.
