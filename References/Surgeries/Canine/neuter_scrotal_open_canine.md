### Procedure

Scrotal Neuter Sutureless



### Preoperative Assessment

Physical exam within normal limits. No signs of systemic illness. CBC/Chemistry reviewed and acceptable for anesthesia.



### Surgical Procedure

Patient placed in dorsal recumbency. Scrotum clipped and prepped in aseptic fashion. Surgical site draped in sterile fashion. A single incision was made directly over the center raphe. Each testicle exteriorized individually through their vaginal tunic. Vas deferens and spermatic vessels individually auto-ligated.  Testicles and associated structures were transected and removed. Hemostasis confirmed.  Incision closed using one to two inverted interrupted monofilament absorbable sutures.



### Recovery

Uneventful recovery. Patient extubated once swallowing reflex returned. Monitored closely post-op. Received warming support.



### Follow-Up Instructions
