## Procedure
Canine Castration with Scrotal Ablation

## Preoperative Assessment
Physical exam within normal limits. No signs of systemic illness. CBC/Chemistry reviewed and acceptable for anesthesia.

## Surgical Procedure
Patient placed in dorsal recumbency. Pre-scrotal and scrotal area clipped and prepped. Surgical site draped in sterile fashion. An elliptical incision created encircling the scrotum about 25% distal to the scrotal base to allow for closure without tension. The spermatic cords were isolated by blunt dissection and double ligated with absorbable monofilament suture. Testes and scrotal sac removed. Hemostasis achieved. Subcutaneous tissues closed using absorbable monofilament suture in a simple continuous pattern. Skin incision closed in an intradermal pattern using absorbable monofilament suture.

## Recovery
Uneventful recovery. Patient extubated once swallowing reflex returned. Monitored closely post-op. Received warming support.

## Follow-Up Instructions
Monitor incision site for redness, swelling, or discharge. Prevent licking or chewing at incision. No bathing or off-leash activity for 10–14 days. Recheck incision in 10–14 days.
