## Procedure
Canine Abdominal Cryptorchidectomy

## Preoperative Assessment
Pre-op screening within normal limits. Patient alert and responsive. No signs of systemic illness observed. The left testis was palpably descended within the scrotum, while the right testis was not palpable in the scrotum or inguinal region, suggestive of abdominal retention. Patient fasted for 12 hours prior to anesthesia. Anesthetic risk classified as ASA I.

## Surgical Procedure
Patient placed in dorsal recumbency. The ventral abdomen including the prepuce was clipped and prepped for aseptic surgery using standard aseptic technique. Prepuce flushed using chlorhexidine solution diluted 50% with water. Prepuce retracted to the right side of the abdomen using a towel clamp. Surgical site draped in sterile fashion excluding the prepuce.

1) Parapreputial approach
A parapreputial incision was made lateral (left) and parallel to the prepuce and medial to the caudal mammary gland/nipple from the dorsal extent of the prepuce to the pubis.  The cranial penile vein was double ligated using monofilament absorbable suture in a simple interrupted pattern and transected. Subcutaneous tissues blunt dissected and incision created through linea alba.

1) Abdominal Testicle
The abdominal cavity was explored, and the undescended right testis was located within the caudal abdomen between the bladder and inguinal canal. The gubernaculum was identified and transected. The spermatic cord, including the vas deferens, testicular artery, and vein, was individually isolated. The spermatic cord was double ligated with absorbable monofilament suture using a modified Miller's knot. The spermatic cord was transected distal to the ligatures and the cryptorchid testis was removed. The surgical site was thoroughly inspected for hemorrhage, and hemostasis was confirmed. 

1) Inguinal Testicle
The abdominal cavity was explored, and the undescended right testis was not located within the abdomen. The bladder was reflected ventrally and the ductus deferens was located dorsal to the bladder. The right ductus deferens was traced to the inguinal canal, the canal exteriorly palpated, and an incision created over the area.  Blunt dissection was used to explore the inguinal area and the cryptorchid testis was located between the inguinal ring and the scrotum. The spermatic cord, including the vas deferens, testicular artery, and vein, was individually isolated. The spermatic cord was double ligated with absorbable monofilament suture using a modified Miller's knot. The spermatic cord was transected distal to the ligatures and the cryptorchid testis was removed. The surgical site was thoroughly inspected for hemorrhage, and hemostasis was confirmed. 

1) The linea alba was closed with absorbable monofilament suture in a simple continuous pattern. The deep subcutaneous tissues were closed using 3 simple interrupted sutures and the superficial subcutaneous tissues closed using absorbable monofilament suture in a simple continuous pattern. The skin incisions were closed in an intradermal pattern using absorbable monofilament suture.

## Recovery
Uneventful recovery. Patient extubated once swallowing reflex returned and was sternal within 15 minutes. Monitored closely in recovery with pain score assessed every 30 minutes. The patient remained comfortable and stable throughout the recovery period.

## Follow-Up Instructions
Monitor incision site for redness, swelling, discharge, or gapping. Apply an Elizabethan collar at all times to prevent licking or chewing at the incision site. No bathing or off-leash activity for 14 days. Keep the incision clean and dry. Administer all prescribed oral medications as directed. Recheck incision in 14 days for assessment of healing.
