## Procedure
Stenotic Nares Correction via Vertical Wedge Aplasty

## Preoperative Assessment
Physical exam within normal limits. No signs of systemic illness. CBC/Chemistry reviewed and acceptable for anesthesia.

## Surgical Procedure
Using a #11 blade, a wedge of tissue is resected in a triangular shape.  The borders are 1) medial: parallel to the nare leaving ~3mm of tissue along the wall of each naris 2) lateral: 40-70 degree angle from the medial border.  3-4 absorbable sutures placed in a simple interrupted pattern along the rostral incision of each naris.  An additional suture is placed at the caudal end of each alar notch to to keep each naris wide during healing.

**Post-Op Findings:** Bilateral vertical wedge resections were performed as described and the nasal passages appeared significantly more open following the procedure.  Hemostasis was effectively achieved with thin gauze strips placed into each nare until extubation. 

## Recovery
Uneventful recovery. Patient extubated once swallowing reflex returned. Monitored closely post-op. Received warming support.

## Follow-Up Instructions
Monitor incision site for redness, swelling, or discharge. Patient must wear e-collar 24x7 until followup. No bathing or off-leash activity for 10â€“14 days. Remove sutures in 14 days.
