## Procedure
Canine Inguinal Cryptorchidectomy

## Preoperative Assessment
Preop screening within normal limits. Patient alert and responsive. No signs of systemic illness observed. The right testis was palpably descended within the scrotum, while the left testis was palpated subcutaneously in the left inguinal region. Patient fasted for 12 hours prior to anesthesia. Anesthetic risk classified as ASA I.

## Surgical Procedure
Patient placed in dorsal recumbency. The ventral abdomen and inguinal region were clipped and prepped in standard aseptic fashion. Surgical site draped in sterile fashion.

A curvilinear skin incision was made directly over the palpable left inguinal cryptorchid testis. The subcutaneous tissues were carefully dissected, and the undescended testis was identified and exteriorized from its subcutaneous location. The spermatic cord, including the vas deferens, testicular artery, and vein, was individually isolated. The spermatic cord was double ligated with absorbable monofilament suture using a modified Miller's knot. The spermatic cord was transected distal to the ligatures and the cryptorchid testis was removed. The surgical site was thoroughly inspected for hemorrhage, and hemostasis was confirmed. The subcutaneous tissues were closed using absorbable monofilament suture in a simple continuous pattern. The skin incision was closed in an intradermal pattern using absorbable monofilament suture.

## Recovery
Uneventful recovery. Patient extubated once swallowing reflex returned and was sternal within 15 minutes. Monitored closely in recovery. The patient remained comfortable and stable throughout the recovery period.

## Follow-Up Instructions
Monitor incision site for redness, swelling, discharge, or gapping. Apply an Elizabethan collar at all times to prevent licking or chewing at the incision site. No bathing or off-leash activity for 14 days. Keep the incision clean and dry. Administer all prescribed oral medications as directed. Recheck incision in 14 days for assessment of healing.
