## Procedure
Flank Ovariohysterectomy

## Preoperative Assessment
Physical exam within normal limits. No signs of systemic illness. CBC/Chemistry reviewed and acceptable for anesthesia.

## Surgical Procedure
Patient placed in right lateral recumbency. Left flank area clipped and aseptically prepped. Surgical site draped in sterile fashion. A small skin incision was made midway between the last rib and iliac crest, just below the transverse processes. Blunt dissection through muscle layers was performed to expose the peritoneum, which was incised to allow abdominal entry. The left uterine horn was located and traced to the ovary. The ovarian pedicle was ligated using a Figure-8 knot and transected distal to the knot. The uterine body was followed to the right ovary.  The contralateral ovarian pedicle was ligated and transected similarly. The uterine body was ligated using monofilament absorbable suture in a modified Miller's knot. The reproductive tract was removed in entirety. Muscle layers closed with monofilament absorbable suture in a cruciate pattern. Subcutaneous tissue closed using monofilament absorbable suture in a cruciate pattern.  Skin opposed using tissue adhesive.

## Recovery
Uneventful recovery. Monitored closely post-op. Provided warming support during recovery.

## Follow-Up Instructions
Monitor incision site for redness, swelling, or discharge. Prevent licking or chewing at incision. No bathing or outdoor activity for 10–14 days. Recheck incision in 10–14 days.
