## Procedure
Abdominal Cryptorchid Castration

## Preoperative Assessment
Physical exam within normal limits. No signs of systemic illness. CBC/Chemistry reviewed and acceptable for anesthesia.

## Surgical Procedure
Ventral abdomen and pre-scrotal area clipped and prepped in aseptic fashion. Surgical site draped in sterile fashion. A small ventral midline incision was made over the pre-pubic area to locate the testicle. Upon identification of the retained testicle in the abdominal cavity, the testicle was exteriorized using gentle dissection. The spermatic cord was ligated with absorbable monofilament suture, and the testicle was excised. Body wall and subcutaneous tissues were closed using absorbable monofilament suture in a simple continuous pattern. Skin was closed with an intradermal pattern using absorbable monofilament suture. Contralateral scrotum clipped and prepped in aseptic fashion. A small incision was made over the testicle. Testicle exteriorized, spermatic cord knotted using a Figure-8 knot. Testicle and structures removed distal to the tie. Hemostasis confirmed. Scrotal incision partially opposed using tissue adhesive.

## Recovery
Uneventful recovery. Patient extubated once swallowing reflex returned. Monitored closely post-op. Received warming support.

## Follow-Up Instructions
Monitor incision site for redness, swelling, or discharge. Prevent licking or chewing at incision. No bathing or off-leash activity for 10–14 days. Recheck incision in 10–14 days.
