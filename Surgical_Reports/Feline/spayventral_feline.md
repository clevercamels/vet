## Procedure
Ventral Ovariohysterectomy

## Preoperative Assessment
Physical exam within normal limits. No signs of systemic illness. CBC/Chemistry reviewed and acceptable for anesthesia.

## Surgical Procedure
Patient placed in dorsal recumbency. Ventral abdomen clipped and prepped in aseptic fashion. Surgical site draped in sterile fashion. A small ventral midline incision was made halfway between umbilicus and cranial edge of pubis. Ovarian pedicles exteriorized following blunt dissection and breaking of suspensory ligaments. Each pedicle was ligated using a Figure-8 knot and transected. The uterine body was ligated cranial to the cervix using absorbable monofilament suture in a modified Miller's knot. Body wall and subcutaneous tissues were closed using absorbable monofilament suture in a simple continuous pattern. Skin was closed with an intradermal pattern using absorbable monofilament suture.

## Recovery
Uneventful recovery. Patient extubated once swallowing reflex returned. Monitored closely post-op. Received warming support.

## Follow-Up Instructions
Monitor incision site for redness, swelling, or discharge. Prevent licking or chewing at incision. No bathing or off-leash activity for 10–14 days. Recheck incision in 10–14 days.
