## Procedure
Pre-scrotal Neuter

## Preoperative Assessment
Physical exam within normal limits. No signs of systemic illness. CBC/Chemistry reviewed and acceptable for anesthesia.

## Surgical Procedure
Patient placed in dorsal recumbency. Pre-scrotal area clipped and prepped in aseptic fashion. Surgical site draped in sterile fashion. A single midline pre-scrotal skin incision was made cranial to the scrotum. Each testicle was exteriorized individually. Both spermatic cords were ligated with absorbable monofilament suture using a modified Miller's knot. Testicles and associated structures were transected and removed. Hemostasis confirmed prior to closure. Subcutaneous tissues closed with absorbable monofilament suture in a simple continuous pattern. Skin closed with an intradermal pattern using absorbable monofilament suture.

## Recovery
Uneventful recovery. Patient extubated once swallowing reflex returned. Monitored closely post-op. Received warming support.

## Follow-Up Instructions
Monitor incision site for redness, swelling, or discharge. Prevent licking or chewing at incision. No bathing or off-leash activity for 10–14 days. Recheck incision in 10–14 days.
