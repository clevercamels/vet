                Requesting a Veterinary Team: Key Responsibilities
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">
                It is a <strong>core requirement</strong> that international animal groups and individuals secure local resources when requesting a veterinary team. Support from the local government and community is highly valued. These factors make a project more desirable, help the <strong>traveling surgery team</strong> develop new projects more efficiently, and are often crucial in determining project feasibility.
            </p>
            <div class="space-y-6">
                <div>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-1">Legality & Licenses</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">International animal groups and individuals <strong>are responsible for investigating</strong> their government's policy regarding foreign veterinarians volunteering services within the country and assisting with obtaining such licenses. They <strong>are also required to secure</strong> any necessary licenses and/or permits required by law to import veterinary supplies.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-1">Safety</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">Safety is the number one priority for our veterinary teams. We do not plan projects in areas that are at war or have a high threat of terrorist activity. We consult the US State Department travel advisory website for all project locations and, as a general rule, do not plan projects in areas with a travel warning.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-1">Local Veterinary Community</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">Local partners <strong>need to establish</strong> whether a local veterinarian and/or individual practicing veterinary medicine is available in the area. Local veterinarians <strong>are expected to be supportive</strong> of a <strong>traveling surgery team</strong> program. The <strong>traveling surgery team</strong> must complement and enhance available veterinary resources, not compete with them. Surgical complications will need to be sent to them for treatment so their cooperation is vital. The cost of treatment for any complications must be borne by the pet owner or the local partner.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-1">Operating Budget</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">The <strong>traveling surgery team</strong> must evaluate and assess all project expenses to determine financial feasibility. Local partners <strong>need to establish their own operating budget</strong> for a surgery clinic as they <strong>are responsible for providing</strong> local resources. Local partners <strong>should actively seek donations</strong> from within their community. Monetary donations received during the clinic will be given to the local coordinating group.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-1">Language</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">The <strong>traveling surgery team</strong> members only speak English. Local partners <strong>are expected to ensure</strong> at least one local bilingual volunteer is present during a <strong>traveling surgery team</strong> clinic.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-1">Controlled Drugs</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">Local partners <strong>are required</strong> to provide controlled drugs, such as ketamine and valium. Purchasing these locally is a necessity. Exporting these drugs from the United States has become difficult and costly.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-1">Accessibility</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">Local partners <strong>need to confirm</strong> that the requested location is easily accessible for a veterinary team. They <strong>are responsible for providing</strong> information on the time and logistical requirements necessary to arrive at the final destination.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-1">Time of Year</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">Weather plays a significant role in project success. We <strong>will avoid</strong> the rainy season in many countries, as bad weather complicates logistics and hinders clinic work days. The <strong>traveling surgery team</strong> <strong>will not schedule</strong> a project around the time when local or national elections are being held. We also refrain from planning projects during national holidays and major celebrations observed in the host country. This reduces attendance at clinics and makes travel challenging.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-1">Local Activities</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">Local partners <strong>are responsible for assisting</strong> in organizing activities for the veterinary team during their leisure time (roughly 2–3 days). Local partners <strong>are required to provide</strong> a list of activities ahead of time so the veterinary team can anticipate extracurricular activities.</p>

                        <li>For a small animal project, the ideal space is at least <strong>900 sq ft</strong> or a building with a couple of adjacent rooms providing that much space.</li>
                        <li>Access to <strong>electricity and running water</strong> and <strong>bathroom facilities</strong> is a necessity. If not available, local partners <strong>are responsible for identifying</strong> and securing alternatives nearby for the veterinary team to utilize.</li>

                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-1">Local partners <strong>must coordinate</strong> local transportation prior to the veterinary team's arrival for:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-600 ml-4">
                        <li>Airport Transfers (to and from).</li>
                        <li>Clinic Work Days (to and from the clinic location, if not walkable).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-sm italic text-gray-500 mt-2">The ideal local transportation is a van/microbus with a capacity for the entire team. Local partners <strong>should seek donations</strong> of transportation from community members or local businesses. If someone from the team can drive locally this is ideal.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-1">Lunches and Drinks</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-1">During clinic work days, local partners <strong>are responsible for providing</strong> the veterinary team with drinks (e.g., potable drinking water suitable for consumption by non-locals and/or soda) as well as breakfast (if not provided by accommodation) and lunch for the entire team.</p>
                    <p class="text-red-600 text-sm font-medium mt-2"><strong>Safety Requirement:</strong> Local partners <strong>must be certain</strong> the meals are coming from a <strong>sanitary source</strong>, as we have experienced severe food poisoning incidents in the past. This can easily halt operations resulting in failure of the project.</p>
                    <p class="text-red-600 text-sm font-medium mt-2"><strong>Recommended Source:</strong> It is recommended that these meals be provided by local restaurants and that you have those restaurants donate and deliver the food. In exchange you will take photos of the team with their food and any banners/etc they would like to provide and post on social media promoting their business. Also ask them to promote the clinic in their place of business and with their contacts to increase patient numbers.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-1">Accommodations</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">Local partners <strong>need to provide</strong> a place for the team to stay. A vacation house or condo rental is preferred in an area near the clinic and in a "tourist" area within walking distance of a grocery and restaurants/bars.</p>

                Preparing for a Veterinary Team: Education & Raising Awareness
            </h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                A primary component of any <strong>traveling surgery team</strong> project is <strong>education and raising awareness</strong>. Since a <strong>traveling surgery team</strong> is only present for a limited amount of time, this responsibility <strong>primarily rests</strong> with the local operating animal group or individual coordinating the visit.
            </p>
            <div class="space-y-4">
                <p class="text-gray-600">Local partners <strong>should utilize</strong> community members who take advantage of the free services as advocates. These individuals will experience the positive effects firsthand and will spread the word.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-600">Local partners <strong>should appeal</strong> to community members by relating animal health and wellbeing issues to their own lives, pointing out the benefits for them and the overall improvement of their community. (See talking points on the benefits of spay/neuter).</p>
                <p class="text-gray-600">Local partners <strong>should run</strong> an advertising campaign for 3–4 weeks prior to the visit. <strong>The key to success is maintaining the issue of animal health on the minds of the community</strong> even when veterinary teams are not present.</p>
            </div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-2">Harnessing & Maintaining Local Support</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Local support is critical for determining both the feasibility and success of a project. Education and raising awareness <strong>should be used</strong> to capture local support. Local partners <strong>need to recognize</strong> the community members and/or businesses that volunteer or donate resources through social media posts and other venues.</p>
