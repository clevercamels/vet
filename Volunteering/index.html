                Requesting a Veterinary Team: Key Responsibilities
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">
                It is a <strong>core requirement</strong> that international animal groups and/or individuals secure local resources when requesting a veterinary team. Support from the local government and/or community is highly valued. These factors make a project more desirable, help the <strong>traveling surgery team</strong> develop new projects more efficiently, and are often crucial in determining project feasibility.
            </p>

            <div class="space-y-6">
                <!-- Legality & Licenses -->
                <div>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-1">Legality & Licenses</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">International animal groups and/or individuals <strong>are responsible for investigating</strong> their government's policy regarding foreign veterinarians volunteering services within the country. They <strong>are also required to secure</strong> any necessary licenses and/or permits required by law to import veterinary supplies.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Safety -->
                <div>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-1">Safety</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">Safety is the number one priority for our veterinary teams. We do not plan projects in areas that are at war or have a high threat of terrorist activity. We consult the US State Department travel advisory website for all project locations and, as a general rule, do not plan projects in areas with a travel warning.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-1">Local Veterinary Community</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">Local partners <strong>need to establish</strong> whether a local veterinarian and/or individual practicing veterinary medicine is available in the area. Local veterinarians <strong>are expected to be supportive</strong> of a <strong>traveling surgery team</strong> program and <strong>are required to coordinate and partake</strong> in our activities. The <strong>traveling surgery team</strong> must complement and enhance available veterinary resources, not compete with them.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">Local partners <strong>need to establish their own operating budget</strong> for a <strong>traveling surgery team</strong> clinic as they <strong>are responsible for providing</strong> some items locally. Local partners <strong>should actively seek donations</strong> from within their community. Monetary donations received during the clinic will be given to the local coordinating charity.</p>
                </div>

                <div>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">The majority of <strong>traveling surgery team</strong> volunteers only speak English. Local partners <strong>are expected to ensure</strong> at least one local bilingual volunteer is present during a **traveling surgery team** clinic.</p>
