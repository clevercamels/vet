## Notes
Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist used for the management of mild to moderate pain, and in some cases, severe pain. It is known for its long duration of action, which can be up to 8–12 hours, making it suitable for post-operative and injury pain management. The injectable form is often preferred in the immediate post-operative period or for patients unable to take oral medications. Buprenorphine is considered to have a lower potential for abuse compared to other opioids. It should be used with caution in animals with liver disease. Respiratory depression and sedation may occur, especially in higher doses.
