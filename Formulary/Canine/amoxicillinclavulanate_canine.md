## Notes
Amoxicillin-Clavulanate is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that combines a beta-lactam (amoxicillin) with a beta-lactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid), making it effective against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. It is commonly used for skin, urinary, respiratory, and dental infections in dogs. GI upset is the most common side effect. Best given with food. Use cautiously in patients with renal impairment.
