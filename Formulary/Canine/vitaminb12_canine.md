## Notes
Vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamin) is essential for normal cell function and is commonly used in dogs with gastrointestinal diseases (such as EPI or chronic enteropathies) where absorption is impaired. SQ injections bypass the GI tract and are the preferred method in cases of malabsorption. Oral supplementation may be used for maintenance after repletion or in mild cases. Monitoring serum cobalamin levels is advised to guide therapy.
