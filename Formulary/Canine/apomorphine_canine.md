##   Notes

Apomorphine is a dopamine agonist that induces emesis in dogs. It is used to remove ingested toxins. Apomorphine is most effective when given IV or IM.  When given into the conjunctival sac, the tablet or crushed tablet is placed, and the eye is flushed with saline after emesis occurs.  Emesis typically occurs within 5-10 minutes.  Adverse effects can include protracted vomiting, lethargy, and respiratory depression.  It should not be used in animals that are already vomiting, or that have ingested caustic substances.
