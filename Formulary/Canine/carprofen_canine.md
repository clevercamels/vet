## Notes
Carprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) widely used in dogs to manage pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis and surgery. It is generally well-tolerated, but potential side effects include gastrointestinal upset, hepatotoxicity, and renal effects. Routine monitoring of liver enzymes is recommended for long-term use. Avoid concurrent use with other NSAIDs or corticosteroids. Always administer with food to reduce the risk of GI irritation.
