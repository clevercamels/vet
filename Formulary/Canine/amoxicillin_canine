## Notes
Amoxicillin is a broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotic effective against many Gram-positive and some Gram-negative organisms. Not effective against beta-lactamase–producing bacteria unless combined with clavulanic acid. Generally well tolerated; GI upset is the most common side effect. Use with caution in renal insufficiency. Injectable formulations should be reconstituted and refrigerated as per label.
