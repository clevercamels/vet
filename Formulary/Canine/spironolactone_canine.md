##   Notes

Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and aldosterone antagonist. It is used in dogs primarily as an adjunct medication in the treatment of congestive heart failure, often in combination with other cardiac medications. It helps to reduce fluid retention and may have some cardioprotective effects. It is also used to treat hypokalemia.
