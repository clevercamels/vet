Robitussin DM is used as a combination cough suppressant (dextromethorphan) and expectorant (guaifenesin). The medication can help relieve dry, non-productive coughs and promote the clearing of mucus from the airways. The medication is generally safe but should be used with caution in patients with underlying respiratory or hepatic conditions. Dextromethorphan can cause drowsiness, while guaifenesin may cause mild gastrointestinal upset.
