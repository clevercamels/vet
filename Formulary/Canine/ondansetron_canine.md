## Notes

Ondansetron is a selective serotonin (5-HT3) receptor antagonist used to prevent and treat nausea and vomiting in dogs. It is particularly effective for chemotherapy-induced emesis but can also be used for other causes of vomiting. While generally well-tolerated, potential side effects include sedation, lethargy, and constipation. Use with caution in patients with liver disease. Oral bioavailability can be variable.
