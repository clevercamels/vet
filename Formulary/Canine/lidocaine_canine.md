## Notes
Lidocaine is a local anesthetic and antiarrhythmic drug commonly used in canine practice for local anesthesia and for controlling certain arrhythmias. It works by blocking sodium channels to prevent nerve conduction, providing effective pain relief for minor surgical procedures or dental work. It is also used intravenously to manage arrhythmias, especially ventricular tachycardia. The injectable form is the most commonly used in veterinary practice, as lidocaine is rarely given orally to dogs. Caution should be used in dogs with heart disease, liver dysfunction, or those receiving other proarrhythmic drugs. In cases of overdose, symptoms may include seizures, respiratory depression, or cardiovascular collapse. Therefore, it is crucial to calculate appropriate dosing and monitor closely.
