## Notes
Cerenia (Maropitant) is a NK-1 receptor antagonist that is used to treat vomiting and nausea, including those caused by motion sickness and chemotherapy. It is highly effective in controlling vomiting and is often used as part of a multi-modal approach for managing nausea and vomiting. The injectable form is often used in the immediate hospital setting for acute vomiting, while the oral formulation can be used for ongoing management at home. It is generally well tolerated, with the most common side effects being sedation or mild GI upset. Cerenia should be used with caution in animals with liver dysfunction, and it is contraindicated in puppies younger than 16 weeks of age.
