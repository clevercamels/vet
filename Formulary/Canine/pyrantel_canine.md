## Notes

Pyrantel is a depolarizing neuromuscular-blocking agent used as an anthelmintic for the treatment of gastrointestinal parasites such as roundworms and hookworms in dogs. It causes paralysis of the worms, which are then expelled in the feces. Often combined with other deworming agents for broader spectrum coverage. Repeat dosing may be required depending on parasite lifecycle and exposure risk.
