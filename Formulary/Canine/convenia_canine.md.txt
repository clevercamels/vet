## Notes
Convenia (Cefovecin) is a long-acting cephalosporin antibiotic that is typically administered as a single subcutaneous injection for the treatment of soft tissue infections, urinary tract infections, and respiratory infections in dogs. Its extended half-life allows for effective treatment with a single injection, making it an excellent option for owners who may have difficulty giving oral medications. Convenia is generally well tolerated but should be used with caution in animals with known hypersensitivity to cephalosporins or penicillins. It is not recommended for use in dogs with severe renal or hepatic disease. GI upset and local reactions at the injection site are possible.
