## Notes  
Codeine is a natural opioid derived from the opium poppy. It is metabolized to multiple active metabolites, including morphine. Efficacy predominantly reflects agonistic actions at μ-opioid receptors. It has approximately 1/10th the potency of morphine
Codeine is a DEA Schedule II drug
The primary effects of codeine occur in the CNS and GI tract 
Codeine is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (MDR-1, ABCB) efflux pumps. Dogs with an MDR-1 mutation may be predisposed to toxicity 
Although codeine undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism, its metabolites are active and it can be given orally
The elimination half-life approximates 1–2 hr in dogs
Duration and effectiveness of analgesis is not well-documented
Predictable adverse reactions to codeine can be profound and generally are μ-opioid receptor-mediated. Respiratory depression may be life-threatening. Other adverse reactions include hypothermia, hyperthermia (particularly in cats), vomiting (subsequent doses may prevent vomiting), constipation, and urinary retention. These can be treated using naloxone, an μ-receptor antagonist
Drug interactions include a prolonged effect when combined with drugs that inhibit CYP450 metabolism. Pharmacodynamic actions may occur and, as such, caution is recommended when combining with drugs that target opioid, dopaminergic, cholinergic, or serotonergic receptors
