## Notes
Ampicillin is a broad-spectrum penicillin antibiotic effective against many Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. It is not effective against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria unless combined with clavulanic acid. Ampicillin is often used for treating infections in soft tissues, urinary tracts, and the respiratory system. It should be used with caution in animals with renal insufficiency. GI upset may occur, and injectable formulations should be reconstituted and stored as per the manufacturer's guidelines.
