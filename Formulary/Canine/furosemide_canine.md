## Notes

Furosemide is a loop diuretic used to reduce fluid retention associated with congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, and other edematous conditions. It acts on the ascending limb of the loop of Henle to inhibit sodium and chloride reabsorption. Monitor hydration status, electrolyte levels (especially potassium), and renal function during use. May cause dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, or ototoxicity at high doses or in rapid IV administration. Dose adjustments are often necessary based on response and disease progression. Ensure access to water at all times.
