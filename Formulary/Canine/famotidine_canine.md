## Notes
Famotidine is an H2 receptor antagonist used primarily to reduce gastric acid secretion, thus aiding in the treatment of gastric ulcers, gastritis, and reflux esophagitis. The injectable form is commonly used in hospitalized patients for immediate control of gastric acid production, while the oral form is typically used for long-term management of these conditions. Famotidine is well tolerated in most dogs, with potential side effects including lethargy or diarrhea. It is generally considered safe for use in dogs with kidney disease, though dosing adjustments may be required. Famotidine should not be used in combination with antacids as it may reduce the efficacy of the medication.
