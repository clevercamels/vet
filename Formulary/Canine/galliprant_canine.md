## Notes

Galliprant (grapiprant) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) in the piprant class, specifically acting as a selective EP4 prostaglandin receptor antagonist. It is indicated for the control of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis in dogs. Unlike traditional NSAIDs, Galliprant does not inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, potentially reducing the risk of gastrointestinal, kidney, and liver side effects.  

It should be administered on an empty stomach. Use with caution in dogs with pre-existing GI disease, dehydration, or renal, hepatic, or cardiovascular conditions. Not recommended for use in dogs under 9 months of age or under 8 pounds.
