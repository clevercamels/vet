## Notes
Ilunocitinib is a non-selective Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitor used for the control of pruritus associated with allergic dermatitis and the control of atopic dermatitis in dogs at least one year of age. It inhibits the activity of JAK enzymes involved in inflammation and itching. The commercially available tablets (4.8 mg, 6.4 mg, 8.5 mg, and 15 mg) are used to achieve the target dose of 0.6 to 0.8 mg/kg once daily. A boxed warning in the labeling addresses the risk of fatal vaccine-induced disease and inadequate immune response to vaccines if administered too close to vaccination. It is recommended to withhold ilunocitinib for at least 28 days to 3 months before vaccination and for at least 28 days afterward. In a clinical study, one daily dose of ilunocitinib was at least as effective as oclacitinib in controlling pruritus, and from Day 28 to Day 112, demonstrated significantly better control of pruritus and skin lesions. Common adverse reactions reported include vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, and anorexia. The safety of ilunocitinib has not been evaluated in breeding, pregnant, or lactating dogs.
