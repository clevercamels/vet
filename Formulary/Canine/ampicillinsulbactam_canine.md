## Notes
Ampicillin/Sulbactam is a combination antibiotic that combines ampicillin, a broad-spectrum penicillin, with sulbactam, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, to enhance its efficacy against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. This combination is often used for soft tissue, urinary tract, and respiratory infections. The sulbactam component allows ampicillin to remain effective against resistant organisms. Not typically administered orally. GI upset and local irritation at injection sites can occur. Use with caution in renal insufficiency.
