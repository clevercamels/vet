## Notes
Doxycycline is a broad-spectrum tetracycline-class antibiotic effective against intracellular organisms and tick-borne pathogens. It is often used for respiratory infections, leptospirosis, and vector-borne diseases. Can cause GI upset and esophageal irritation—administer with food and water, and avoid dry pilling. Avoid use in young growing animals due to potential for dental staining and bone development issues. Use upper end of dose if possible.
