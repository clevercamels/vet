## Notes  
Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker primarily used for managing systemic hypertension in dogs. It causes peripheral arteriolar vasodilation with minimal effect on cardiac contractility. Blood pressure should be rechecked within 7–10 days of starting or adjusting therapy. Use with caution in dogs with advanced cardiac disease or hepatic impairment. Hypotension is the most common adverse effect. Tablets can be split or compounded for precise dosing.
