##   Notes

Buprenorphine is a partial mu-opioid agonist used for mild to moderate pain relief in cats. It has a long duration of action compared to other opioids. It is well-absorbed via the transmucosal route in cats. Sedation is a common side effect. Buprenorphine has a ceiling effect, meaning that increasing the dose beyond a certain point does not increase its analgesic effects.
