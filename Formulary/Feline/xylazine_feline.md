## Notes

Xylazine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist used for sedation, analgesia, and muscle relaxation in cats. It is also used to induce vomiting. However, it's less commonly used in cats than in dogs due to a higher risk of adverse effects. It can cause significant bradycardia, respiratory depression, vomiting, and excitement during recovery. Its effects can be reversed with yohimbine.  The dose for inducing vomiting is higher than the dose for sedation/analgesia.
