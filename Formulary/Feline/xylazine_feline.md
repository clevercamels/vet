## Veterinary Emergency Protocol: Canine Grape/Raisin Ingestion Toxicity

**Presenting Complaint:** Known or suspected ingestion of grapes or raisins.

**Definition:** Grape and raisin toxicity in dogs is an idiosyncratic reaction that can lead to acute kidney injury (AKI). The toxin is tartaric acid.

**Triage:**

1.  **Initial Assessment (within 1-2 minutes):**

    * **History:**

        * Amount of grapes or raisins ingested (number or weight in grams/ounces).
        * Time of ingestion.
        * Dog's weight.
        * Pre-existing conditions, especially kidney disease.
    * **Observation:**
        * Vomiting
        * Lethargy
        * Anorexia
        * Abdominal pain
        * Dehydration
        * Oliguria or anuria (decreased or absent urine production)
        * PU/PD (increased drinking and urination) may be seen later
    * **Cardiovascular:**
        * Tachycardia (rapid heart rate) - may be present, especially with dehydration
    * **Respiratory:**
        * Increased respiratory rate (compensatory for metabolic acidosis)
    * **Renal:**
        * Signs of kidney injury may not be present initially.

2.  **Immediate Actions (0-5 minutes):**

    * **Decontamination (if ingestion within 2 hours):**
        * **Induce Emesis:**
            * If the dog is asymptomatic and ingestion is recent (within 2 hours), induce vomiting.
            * Contraindications to emesis:
                * Symptomatic patients (vomiting, lethargy)
                * Pre-existing conditions (e.g., megaesophagus)
                * Decreased level of consciousness
            * Agents:
                * 3% Hydrogen Peroxide: 1-2 ml/kg orally, maximum 45 ml. May repeat once after 10-15 minutes if no emesis.
                * Apomorphine (IV or conjunctival): 0.03-0.04 mg/kg IV.
        * **Activated Charcoal:**
            * Administer activated charcoal (1-5 g/kg orally) after emesis.
            * May repeat activated charcoal administration every 4-6 hours.
    * **Establish IV Access:**
        * Place an intravenous catheter in the cephalic or saphenous vein.
    * **Fluid Therapy:**
        * Initiate intravenous crystalloid fluid therapy (e.g., Lactated Ringerâ€™s or 0.9% saline) at twice the maintenance rate.

3.  **Stabilization (15-60 minutes):**

    * **Further Assessment:**
        * **Cardiovascular:** Reassess HR, pulse quality.
        * **Respiratory:** Evaluate respiratory rate and effort.
        * **Abdominal Palpation:** Assess for abdominal pain.
        * **Hydration Status:** Evaluate for dehydration (MM, CRT).
    * **Diagnostics:**
        * **Blood Work:**
            * Serum biochemistry profile (BUN, creatinine, electrolytes, phosphorus, calcium).  Baseline and repeat at 12-24 hour intervals.
            * Complete blood count (CBC).
            * SDMA (Symmetric dimethylarginine):  Can be an earlier indicator of kidney injury than creatinine.
        * **Urinalysis:**
            * Evaluate urine specific gravity, sediment.
            * Monitor urine output (place urinary catheter if necessary).
    * **Treatment:**
        * **Intravenous Fluids:**
            * Continue aggressive IV fluid therapy (2-3 times maintenance) for at least 48-72 hours.
            * Monitor urine output closely.  If anuric or severely oliguric, consider referral for hemodialysis.
        * **Monitor Renal Parameters:**
            * Recheck BUN, creatinine, phosphorus, and electrolytes every 12-24 hours.
        * **Anti-emetics:**
            * If vomiting persists:
                * Maropitant (1 mg/kg IV or SQ)
                * Ondansetron (0.1-0.2 mg/kg IV)
        * **Gastroprotectants:**
            * H2 antagonists (e.g., famotidine) or proton pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole) may be beneficial.
        * **Phosphate binders:**
            * If hyperphosphatemia develops:
                * Aluminum hydroxide (30-90 mg/kg PO TID)
        * **Diuretics:**
            * If oliguria develops despite aggressive fluid therapy, consider:
                * Mannitol (0.25-0.5 g/kg IV over 15-20 minutes)
                * Furosemide (1-2 mg/kg IV)
                * *Use diuretics cautiously and only if the patient is adequately hydrated.*
        * **Blood pressure monitoring:**
             * Monitor and treat hypertension if present.
        * **Nutritional Support**
             * If anorexia persists, consider assisted feeding (nasoesophageal or esophagostomy tube)

4.  **Post-Stabilization Management:**

    * **Monitoring:**
        * Monitor renal parameters (BUN, creatinine, phosphorus) daily until stable.
        * Monitor urine output.
        * Monitor hydration status.
        * Monitor for signs of worsening kidney injury.
    * **Fluid Therapy:**
        * Continue IV fluids as needed, adjusting rate based on renal parameters and urine output.  May need to decrease as renal function improves, or increase if patient becomes oliguric/anuric.
    * **Renal Function Support:**
        * Continue medications as needed (e.g., phosphate binders).
        * If AKI is severe or unresponsive to medical management, consider referral for hemodialysis.
    * **Nutritional Management:**
        * Provide a renal-protective diet.
        * Ensure adequate caloric intake.
    * **Long-term monitoring:**
        * Recheck renal parameters 1-2 weeks after discharge, and then as indicated by the patient's condition.  Some dogs may develop chronic kidney disease.

**Prognosis:**

The prognosis for grape/raisin toxicity in dogs is variable and depends on several factors:

* **Amount ingested:** Higher amounts increase the risk of AKI.
* **Time to treatment:** Early decontamination and aggressive fluid therapy improve the prognosis.
* **Severity of kidney injury:** Dogs that develop severe oliguric or anuric AKI have a poorer prognosis.
* **Pre-existing conditions:** Dogs with pre-existing kidney disease are at higher risk and have a worse prognosis.

With prompt and aggressive treatment, many dogs recover from grape/raisin toxicity. However, some may develop permanent kidney damage or may not survive, particularly if they develop severe AKI.
