## Notes

Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet medication used to prevent abnormal blood clot formation in cats, particularly in those with heart disease such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) or a history of arterial thromboembolism (ATE). It is an "off-label" use in veterinary medicine. Common side effects include gastrointestinal upset and a bitter taste, which can cause drooling. There is a small risk of bleeding, and some cats may be resistant to the drug's effects.
