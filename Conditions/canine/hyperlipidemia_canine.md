# Canine Hyperlipidaemia

## Overview

Hyperlipidaemia, characterized by increased blood lipid concentrations (triglycerides, cholesterol, or both), is common in dogs and is now recognized as a clinically significant condition requiring systematic diagnosis and treatment. *Hyperlipoproteinemia* is often used interchangeably with *hyperlipidaemia*.

## Lipid Metabolism in Dogs

Canine lipid metabolism involves exogenous (dietary) and endogenous pathways. Lipids are transported in plasma via lipoproteins (*chylomicrons, VLDL, LDL, HDL*). Notably, dogs possess a unique HDL subtype (*HDL1*) and appear to lack *cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP)* activity, which influences HDL metabolism.

## Types of Hyperlipidaemia

### Secondary Hyperlipidaemia

This is the most common form in dogs. It can be caused by various underlying conditions, including:

- Endocrine disorders  
- Pancreatitis  
- Cholestasis  
- Protein-losing nephropathy  
- Obesity  
- High-fat diets  
- Certain drugs

### Primary Hyperlipidaemia

Less common overall but seen more frequently in certain breeds. *Hypertriglyceridaemia of Miniature Schnauzers* is the most prevalent primary form in the US and is thought to have a genetic basis.

## Potential Complications

While sometimes considered benign, recent evidence suggests canine hyperlipidaemia can be associated with several health issues:

- Pancreatitis  
- Liver disease  
- Atherosclerosis  
- Ocular disease  
- Seizures

## Management

The initial step in managing hyperlipidaemia is to determine if it is primary or secondary by investigating and ruling out potential underlying causes of secondary hyperlipidaemia.

### Secondary Hyperlipidaemia

Treatment focuses on successfully managing the primary disorder, which usually resolves the hyperlipidaemia.

### Primary Hyperlipidaemia

Management typically involves:

- Administration of ultra low-fat diets, such as Hill's Prescription Diet i/d Low Fat  
- Sometimes combined with lipid-lowering agents such as:
  - Omega-3 fatty acids  
  - Fibrates (e.g., gemfibrozil)  
  - Niacin

## Conclusion

Disorders of lipid metabolism in dogs warrant appropriate consideration and treatment, especially given their potential association with significant diseases like pancreatitis and liver disease.
