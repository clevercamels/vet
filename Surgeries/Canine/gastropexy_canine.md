## Procedure
Prophylactic Gastropexy

## Preoperative Assessment
Physical exam within normal limits. No signs of systemic illness. CBC/Chemistry reviewed and acceptable for anesthesia.

## Surgical Procedure
Patient placed in dorsal recumbency. Ventral abdomen clipped and prepped in aseptic fashion. Surgical site draped in sterile fashion. A ventral midline skin incision was created. The stomach was exteriorized, and the pyloric antrum was isolated. A partial-thickness incision was made in the seromuscular layer of the pyloric antrum and a corresponding incision on the right abdominal wall caudal to the last rib. Access and visualization to the interior abdominal wall was achieved using the assistance of a sterile-gloved assistant and towel clamps. The two incisions were apposed using absorbable monofilament suture in a continuous pattern to achieve a permanent adhesion between the stomach and body wall. Body wall and subcutaneous tissues were closed using absorbable monofilament suture in a simple continuous pattern. Skin was closed with an intradermal pattern using absorbable monofilament suture.

## Recovery
Uneventful recovery. Patient extubated once swallowing reflex returned. Monitored closely post-op. Received warming support.

## Follow-Up Instructions
Monitor incision site for redness, swelling, or discharge. Prevent licking or chewing at incision. No bathing or off-leash activity for 10–14 days. Recheck incision in 10–14 days.
